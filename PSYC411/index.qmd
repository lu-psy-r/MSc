# Welcome

Welcome to this module PSYC401!

Please watch the [welcome video (part 1)](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/panopto/view.php?id=1977256) to give you an outline of how this module works.

Please then [watch the second video](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/panopto/view.php?id=1977297) on how to access the software for this module. This second video shows you how to access the University (virtual) computers and software for this module - the software is called R studio. If you have any trouble following these instructions, please let us know via the Discussion Forum.

The [third video](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/panopto/view.php?id=1977300) shows you how you can change the accessibility and appearance settings for R studio - if you like.

The [fourth video](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=1979429) is a chat between Rob Davies and Padraic Monaghan giving you a bit of an insight into what we'd like you to take from this module and what our philosophy is for teaching.
