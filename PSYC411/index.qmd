# Welcome

Welcome to this module PSYC411! Very glad to have you here!! 

Rob Davies ![](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/images/people/3324.jpg){width="1in"} and Padraic Monaghan ![](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/images/people/1290.jpg){width="1in"} are the lecturers on this module. 

We are looking forward to meeting you!


This module is designed for students who have never done data analysis or statistics before, as well as those who have background in this. 

We have set up the module so that there are different exercises depending on your background. 

* For those who are new to data analysis and statistics, there is a week-by-week step-by-step guide to all you need to know to become a masters-level expert in interpreting and analysing psychological data. 

* For those of you who have already used our software (R-studio) for analysis before, after revising the foundations of what you need to know you can move on quickly to the extra explorative exercises where you can hone and broaden your skills.
