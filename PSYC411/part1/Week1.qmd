---

## 1.1 Overview

This week, there are three mini lectures, and then a practical workbook to get you going with R-studio. 

Before the practical on Tuesday, please try to work through the practical workbook (in the first practical we will form groups of people to work together on the workbooks, for now you can work on the practical workbook individually or with anyone else on the course you are in touch with!).

Bring your questions (and/or answers) to the practical.

## 1.2 Learning Goals

By the end of Week 1, you should be able to:

* Understand the importance of data analysis and statistics

* Identify types of data in psychology (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)

* Understand means and standard deviations

*Understand standardized scores (Z-scores)

* Use R-studio to begin to manipulate data, investigate means and standard deviations, and convert scores into Z-scores

## 1.3 Lectures

Watch Lecture week1 part1.

Watch Lecture week1 part2, stop halfway through and do the Lecture week1 part2 quiz (not assessed), go back and watch the end of Lecture week 1 part2.

## 1.4 Practical Materials

### 1.4.1 Workbook

In your group (or on your own until you've formed a group), work through this workbook, note any problems and questions you have, 
and come prepared to the online practical class to go through the tasks and ask your questions.

If you've done statistics using R-studio before then Parts 1 and 2 will be just
revision for you. In which case, Part 3 is where you can focus your work.

Part 1 of this workbook reproduces what you saw in the week 1 part 3 lecture.

Part 2 gives you some more exercises in using R studio for finding means, 
standard deviations, z scores, and drawing histograms.
                                        
Part 3 provides some more extended tasks you can do to practise exploring what R
-studio can do and develop your skills further. If you are new to R-studio then parts 1
and 2 cover what you need to know, and Part 3 contains some more optional exercises.


#### 1.4.1.1 Part One: repeat the steps from lecture 1 part 3

##### Task One: Open Rstudio

1. From a computer on the campus wifi (or from home via the University VPN), you can access R Studio at:

[Lancaster Psychology R Studio Server](http://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk){target="_blank}

At the login screen, use your university username (e.g., bloggsj) and password.

###### What does RStudio look like?

When RStudio starts, it will look something like this: ![Startup screen](images/RStudio_startup_screen.png)

RStudio has three panels or windows: there are tabs for Console (taking up the left hand side), Environment (and History top right), Current file (bottom right). You will also see a 4th window for a script or set of commands you develop, also (on the left hand side).

##### Task Two: using the console

::: callout-tip
Text that is highlighted with a grey background denotes code, rather than typical prose. Code is different to other forms of writing, such as essays, because the syntax, order and words need to be quite specific. For some longer chunks of code, as you will see below, they are formatted slightly differently.
:::

2. In the “console” part of the R window, next to the >, type `10 + 30`.  Press return.

```{r eval=FALSE}
10 + 30                        
```

::: callout-tip
If you hover your mouse over the box that includes the code snippet, a 'copy to clipboard' icon will appear in the top right corner of the box. Click that to copy the code. Now you can easily paste it into your script. 
:::

It should give you the answer 40.

3.	In the console, type `a <- 40` and press Return.

```{r eval=FALSE}
a <- 40                      
```

4. Now type `a` and press return. It should give you the answer 40. `a` is called an object, think of it like a bucket that you can keep a number, or some numbers, or actually all kinds of stuff in.

5.	Now let’s look at a function, `sqrt`. `sqrt` is a function that takes the square root of whatever is inside the brackets. In the console, type `sqrt(13)`. Press Return.

6.	Now find the square root of the object `a` by typing `sqrt(a)`. Press return.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
# Answer
```{r}
a<- 40
sqrt(a)
```
:::


##### Task Three: finding distributions

7. Make a new object `b`, and put the following list of children’s attachment scores into it

```{r eval=FALSE}
b <- c( 4, 1, 5, 3, 8, 2, 2, 6, 8, 5, 4, 1, 6, 5, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 1, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 4, 8, 6, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 8, 8, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 1, 5, 6, 8, 6, 7, 2, 7)
```

8.	Check it works by typing `b`, press return. 

9.	Find the mean of these numbers by typing `mean(b)`.

10.	Find the median of these numbers by typing `median(b)`.

11.	Find the standard deviation of these numbers by typing `sd(b)`.

12.	Draw a histogram of these numbers by typing `hist(b)`.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
# Answer
```{r}
b <- c( 4, 1, 5, 3, 8, 2, 2, 6, 8, 5, 4, 1, 6, 5, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 1, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 4, 8, 6, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 8, 8, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 1, 5, 6, 8, 6, 7, 2, 7)
mean(b)
median(b)
sd(b)
hist(b)
```
:::


##### Task Four: z scores

13.	Make a new object b_z and assign to it the z scores of the values from b:
``
```{r eval=FALSE}
b_z <- scale(b)
```

14.	Check that it worked by typing `b_z`.

15.	Draw a histogram of b_z by typing `hist(b_z)`.

#### 1.4.1.2 Part Two: extra practice

##### Task Five: investigating distributions

16.	Let’s make three new objects, with the marks from three people’s university masters courses. They are called annie, saj, and carrie and they took 10 courses each. We use the special notation `c()` to indicate a list, each number in the list is separated by a comma. Type the following into the console:

```{r eval=FALSE}

annie <- c(55, 95, 85, 65, 65, 85, 65, 95, 65, 75)
saj <- c(65, 85, 95, 75, 65, 55, 55, 75, 95, 85)
carrie <- c(75, 65, 95, 95, 55, 85, 75, 55, 95, 55)

```

17.	Who has the highest average (mean) score for their course? 

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Hint
use the `mean()` function
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
# Answer
They all have the same mean = 75.
```{r}
annie <- c(55, 95, 85, 65, 65, 85, 65, 95, 65, 75)
saj <- c(65, 85, 95, 75, 65, 55, 55, 75, 95, 85)
carrie <- c(75, 65, 95, 95, 55, 85, 75, 55, 95, 55)
mean(annie)
mean(saj)
mean(carrie)
```
:::



18.	Who has the most variable scores for their course?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Hint
use the `sd()` function
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
# Answer
Annie has the least variable scores sd = 14.14214, then saj sd = 14.90712, then carrie sd = 16.99673. Carrie is most variable.
```{r}
sd(annie); sd(saj); sd(carrie)
```
:::


19.	What is the median score for each student?. What does this mean about the distribution of each students’ scores? Use the function `hist()` to draw the distributions to help you see.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Hint
you can use the `summary()` function, or the `median()` function
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
# Answer
 median(annie) = 70; median(saj) and median(carrie) are both median = 75. So, annie’s scores are positive skewed – more lower values and a few (very) high values. saj looks like a uniform (flat) distribution, and carrie is different than normal distribution – maybe bimodal? In each case it’s very hard to tell from so few data points, and more data would make it clearer.
```{r}
median(annie); median(saj); median(carrie)
hist(annie); hist(saj); hist(carrie)
```
:::


##### Task Six: standardised scores: Z scores

20.	Make a new object called `annie_z` and use the function `scale` to convert annie’s scores to z-scores: in the console type:

```{r eval=FALSE}
annie_z <- scale(annie)
```


21.	You can have a look at the standardised scores of annie, by just typing `annie_z`. To what did annie’s highest initial score of 95 convert to?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
# Answer
mean = 0, sd = 1. So that’s good, the z-score conversion worked.
```{r}
mean(annie_z); sd(annie_z)

```
:::


22.	What is the mean and standard deviation of annie_z’s standardised scores?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
# Answer
1.4142136
You could find this by just eyeballing (searching through) the data, or by using the function `max`:
```{r}
annie_z <- scale(annie)
max(annie); max(annie_z)
```
:::


23.	Draw a histogram of annie’s standardised scores, in the console type `hist(annie_z)`. What is the peak frequency value?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
# Answer
Between -1 and -0.5.
```{r}
hist(annie_z)
```
:::


24.	Bonus extra: If you want to find out the proportion of scores lower than a particular score you can do it like this in R-studio: `pnorm(x)` where x is the z-score you’re interested in. What is the proportion of scores lower than annie’s highest grade score?


::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
# Answer
pnorm(1.4142136) = 0.9213504, 92% of scores (in a population) are lower than her highest score.
```{r}
pnorm(1.4142136)
```
:::

#### 1.4.1.3 Part Three: Extras

If you’ve whizzed through the previous tasks, then you can move on to the following activities to explore further the functionality of R studio.

##### Task Seven: Exploring operators. 

So far, we’ve just looked at `+` as an operator. Go to this page: https://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html

25.	 In the console, assign the object `d` to be 100 multiplied by 246.

26.	In the console, assign the object `e` to be 84 divided by 32.1.

27.	Assign the variable `f` to 8 to the power of 4 (in R this is called exponentiation).

28.	What is the result of `d` added to `e` all divided by `f`


::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
# Answers
6.006498
```{r}
d <- 100 * 246; e <- 84/32.1; f <- 8^4;
f <- 8**4 # this does the same thing as 8^4
(d+e)/f 
```
:::


##### Task Eight: Exploring functions

So far, we’ve just looked at the square root function `sqrt()`. Go to this page:
https://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html
27.	What is the result of `abs(-5.3)`? What does the `abs` function do?

28.	Using the `seq()` function, generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 30 in intervals of 3.

29.	Assign the sequence generated in step 28 to a new object. Now compute the mean of the sequence of numbers. (remember that objects can be a single number, or a sequence of numbers (called an array or a vector) or anything you want to put into it – remember, think of objects as buckets).

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Stuck? Here's the solution
Try out the following code, pay special attention to how the sentences above "convert" into R code.
```{r eval=FALSE}

sequence <- seq(0,30, 3)
mean(sequence)

```
