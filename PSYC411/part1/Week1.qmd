title: Week 1. Introducing Data
subtitle: Written by Padraic Monaghan
order: 3
---

## 1.1 Overview

This week, there are three mini lectures, and then a practical workbook to get you going with R-studio. 

Before the practical on Tuesday, please try to work through the practical workbook (in the first practical we will form groups of people to work together on the workbooks, for now you can work on the practical workbook individually or with anyone else on the course you are in touch with!).

## 1.2 Learning Goals

By the end of Week 1, you should be able to:

* Understand the importance of data analysis and statistics

* Identify types of data in psychology (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)

* Understand means and standard deviations

* Understand standardized scores (Z-scores)

* Use R-studio to begin to manipulate data, investigate means and standard deviations, and convert scores into Z-scores

## 1.4 Practical Materials

### 1.4.1 Workbook

In your group (or on your own until you've formed a group), work through this workbook, note any problems and questions you have, 
and come prepared to the online practical class to go through the tasks and ask your questions.

If you've done statistics using R-studio before then Parts 1 and 2 will be just
revision for you. In which case, Part 3 is where you can focus your work.

Part 1 of this workbook reproduces what you saw in the week 1 part 3 lecture.

Part 2 gives you some more exercises in using R studio for finding means, 
standard deviations, z scores, and drawing histograms.
                                        
Part 3 provides some more extended tasks you can do to practise exploring what R
-studio can do and develop your skills further. If you are new to R-studio then parts 1
and 2 cover what you need to know, and Part 3 contains some more extending, optional exercises.


#### 1.4.1.1 Part One: repeat the steps from lecture 1 part 3

##### Task One: Open Rstudio

1. Startup Rstudio

To log in to the R server, first make sure that you have the VPN switched on, or you will need to be connected to the university network (Eduroam). To set up the VPN, follow ISS [instructions here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/digital/services/university-it-network/vpn/) or connecting to Eduroam [here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/digital/services/university-it-network/wi-fi/).

When you are connected, navigate to [https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk](https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk), where you will be shown a login screen that looks like the below. Click the option that says "Sign in with SAML".

![](/Includes/1LoginSAML.png) <!-- says no image but it's all about the include setup -->

This will take you through to the University login screen, where you should enter your username (e.g. ivorym) and then your university password. This will then redirect you to the R server where you can start using RStudio!

::: {.callout-note}
If you have already logged in through the university login, then you may not see the username/password screen. When you click login, you will be redirected straight to RStudio. This is because the server shares the login information securely across the university.
