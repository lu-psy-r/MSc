# 3.4 Practical Materials

## 3.4.1 Workbook

Part 1 is revision from last week.

Part 2 is to reproduce the Lecture week 3 part 3 analyses.

Part 3 is to practise manipulating data.

Part 4 is starting making visualisations of data.

Part 5 is some more advanced manipulation of data.

Part 6 is extra: extending your knowledge.

If you've followed a course in R studio before then Parts 1 and 6 will extend your knowledge.


#### 3.4.1.1 Part 1: Revision from last week

If you had a look at the data from Stamkou et al.'s study from last week, then that's great, in which case follow Task 1, otherwise just go straight to Task 2.

##### Task 1: Describe Stamkou et al.'s study from last week

1. Talk to your group about what you did.

2. From the Stamkou et al. data, can you look at whether there was a change in happiness ratings from the baseline (PracticeHappy) to after watching the video (VideoHappy)?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Hint
Remember first to load in the libraries Hmisc and tidyverse, and then use get.spss to load in the data:
There are two ways to load in data that comes from spss - when the datafile ends with .sav
The way we looked at doing this in week 1 workbook used the library Hmisc and then the function get.spss
The other way is to use the library haven, and the function read_sav
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
``` {r eval=FALSE}
library(Hmisc)
dat <- spss.get("stamkou_Study 1_edited data.sav")
```
or:
``` {r eval=FALSE}
library(haven)
dat <- read_sav("stamkou_Study 1_edited data.sav")
```
:::

3. If you used get.spss, though, the data, as you may have seen, is rather messy, and needs some tidying up.
If you used read_sav then these issues don't apply.
But for get.spss, in particular, the ratings of happiness are a bit all over the place.
(this is because get.spss keeps information about responses but also what those responses mean
and sometimes mixes them up together).
We want these to just be numbers, 1,2,3,4, but instead they have the coding for what the numbers 
mean as well. If you've loaded in your data set into an object called "dat":
then the following lines will work to tidy things up:
``` {r eval=FALSE}
dat$PracticeHappy <- gsub("\n1=not happy at all\n", "1", dat$PracticeHappy)
dat$PracticeHappy <- gsub("\n2=a bit happy\n", "2", dat$PracticeHappy)
dat$PracticeHappy <- gsub("\n3=quite happy\n", "3", dat$PracticeHappy)
dat$PracticeHappy <- gsub("\n4=very happy\n", "4", dat$PracticeHappy)
dat$PracticeHappy <- as.numeric(dat$PracticeHappy)
dat$VideoHappy <- gsub("\n1=not happy at all\n", "1", dat$VideoHappy)
dat$VideoHappy <- gsub("\n2=a bit happy\n", "2", dat$VideoHappy)
dat$VideoHappy <- gsub("\n3=quite happy\n", "3", dat$VideoHappy)
dat$VideoHappy <- gsub("\n4=very happy\n", "4", dat$VideoHappy)
dat$VideoHappy <- as.numeric(dat$VideoHappy)
```

4. Now, you can look at plotting the happiness ratings at baseline against happiness ratings
after the children watch the video. You can also look at the means and standard deviations of the
ratings to see if there is a numerical difference. What are the means and SDs?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Hint
Remember: You will need to load in the tidyverse library at this stage.
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
``` {r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
plot(dat$PracticeHappy, dat$VideoHappy)
summarise(dat, mean(PracticeHappy), sd(PracticeHappy), mean(VideoHappy, na.rm=T), sd(VideoHappy, na.rm=T))
```
mean(PracticeHappy) sd(PracticeHappy) mean(VideoHappy, na.rm = T) sd(VideoHappy, na.rm = T)

1            2.638889         0.7822321                    1.983051                  0.828982


or you could use:
``` {r eval=FALSE}
mean(dat$PracticeHappy); sd(dat$PracticeHappy); mean(dat$VideoHappy); sd(dat$VideoHappy)
```
:::

5. Later in the workbook, we use the functions group_by and summarise,
so you could use these to look at the means separately for the emotion conditions 
(EmotionCondition) - how would you do that? What are the means and SDs? 
What effect does there seem to be of the emotion conditions on happiness mood change?
If you don't yet know how to do this, then come back to it after you've completed the rest of
the workbook.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
``` {r eval=FALSE}
dat2 <- group_by(dat, EmotionCondition)
summarise(dat2, mean(PracticeHappy), sd(PracticeHappy), mean(VideoHappy, na.rm=T), sd(VideoHappy, na.rm=T))
```
EmotionCondition `mean(PracticeHappy)` `sd(PracticeHappy)` `mean(VideoHappy, na.rm = T) sd(VideoHappy, na.rm = T)`

1 Awe                               2.68               0.800                          2.08                0.747

2 Joy                               2.5                0.701                          2.22                0.956

3 Control                           2.74               0.835                          1.62                0.648

happiness decreases in all conditions, but most for Control, mid for Awe, least for Joy conditions
:::


#### Part 2: Reproduce the Lecture week3 part3 analyses

##### Task 2: Load in the data, draw a histogram, find means and standard deviations

6.  Create a new r script, called psyc411_week3.r, and clear out R studio ready for a new script using `rm(list=ls())`.

7.  Download the data files from last week once again on the vocabulary tests here: [PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv](data/wk2/PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.zip). 

8.  Load the data into an object called "dat" using `read_csv()`, what command line do you use? (remember to set the working directory)

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
```{r eval=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv")
```
:::

9.  View the data. What command do you use?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
```{r eval=FALSE}
View(dat)
```
:::

10. We can make a histogram of the first time people took the Gent
    vocabulary test:

```{r eval=FALSE}
hist(dat$Gent_1_score)
```

11. And a histogram of the second time people took the Gent test, what
    command line do you use?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
```{r eval=FALSE}
hist(dat$Gent_2_score)
```
:::

12. We will use a function called summarise. This is more powerful than just using mean(dat\$Gent_1_score) and sd(dat\$Gent_1_score), etc.
because it can give us summary statistics on subgroups of data, and can give us much more than just means and SDs.
Have a look at the documentation for the function:

``` {r eval=FALSE}
?summarise
```

We use it like this:
first put the object that the variables are in, then tell summarise what to do with each variable - eg 
compute the mean or sd or number of times it's measured (that's the n() part), or whatever:

``` { eval=FALSE}
summarise(dat, mean(Gent_1_score), sd(Gent_1_score), mean(Gent_2_score), sd(Gent_2_score), n())
```

However, this won't have worked - it will just say NA for means and SDs.
This is because summarise doesn't work if there are missing values (called NA).
So, we have to tell summarise to ignore the NAs.

``` { eval=FALSE}
summarise(dat, mean(Gent_1_score, na.rm=T), sd(Gent_1_score, na.rm=T), mean(Gent_2_score, na.rm=T), sd(Gent_2_score, na.rm=T), n())
```

What is the mean and standard deviation of Gent_1_score and Gent_2_score?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
```{r eval=FALSE}
summarise(dat, mean(Gent_1_score, na.rm=T), sd(Gent_1_score, na.rm=T), mean(Gent_2_score, na.rm=T), sd(Gent_2_score, na.rm=T), n())
```
`mean(Gent_1_score, na.rm = T)` `sd(Gent_1_score, na.rm = T)` `mean(Gent_2_score, na.rm = T)` `sd(Gent_2_score, na-rm= T)` `n()`

 57.4                          16.0                            57.1      18.7    81
:::


##### Task 3: Use ggplot to draw some histograms:

13. Now we are going to use another way of making graphs. This is more
    flexible than the `hist` function. Here is how to make a histogram
    of the Gent vocabulary scores:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(dat, aes(x = Gent_1_score) ) + geom_histogram(fill="blue") + labs(title="Gent Vocabulary Test 1", x = "Vocabulary Score", y = "Frequency")

```

14. And for the second Gent test:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(dat, aes(x = Gent_2_score) ) + geom_histogram(fill="red") + labs(title="Gent Vocabulary Test 2", x = "Vocabulary Score", y = "Frequency")

```

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
Breaking it down: 

`ggplot(dat, aes(x = Gent_1_score))`: this calls the plotting function ggplot

`dat`: we specify the data set we will use

and we set the data for the plot, in this case we say that the x value (so
that's what will be along the x-axis in the graph) is the Gent_1\_score.
We put this inside `aes()`, which stands for "aesthetic".

`+ geom_histogram(fill="blue")`: this adds a graph of type histogram and
colours it blue

`+ labs(title="Gent Vocabulary Test", x = "Vocabulary Score", y = "Frequency")`:
this adds labels to the graph: title, the x-axis label and the y-axis
label.
:::

#### 4.1.3.3 Part 3: Practise manipulating data

##### Task 4: Practise manipulating data

15. Let's keep only some of the variables from the dataset dat - let's
    remove Gender_code, and Dyslexia_diagnosis. Keep the other variables
    using `select()` and load this into summarydata

```{r eval=FALSE}
summarydata <- select(dat, subject_ID, Age, english_status, Gender, Shipley_Voc_Score, Gent_1_score, Gent_2_score, academic_year)
```

16. Next we will have a bit more of a wander around the data to get a
    feel for it. We will first use the function `arrange()`, which
    changes the order of observations (rows):

```{r eval=FALSE}
arrange(summarydata, Shipley_Voc_Score)
```

What is the lowest score of a participant on the Shipley Vocabulary
questionnaire? (You may like to make a new object, which is the result
of the `arrange` function, then look at it in View).

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
10
:::

17. If you want to order from highest to lowest, you have to use the
    `desc()` function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
arrange(summarydata, desc(Shipley_Voc_Score))
```

What is the highest value on the Shipley Vocabulary Test? How many
participants have this highest score?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
38, 2 participants
:::

18. Next we will use the `filter()` function. This includes or excludes
    certain observations (rows). Let's just include the participants
    with English as a first language and put this into a new object,
    called summarydata_enl.
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
summarydata_enl <- filter(summarydata, english_status == 'native')
```

What are the mean and SD values of the Shipley Vocabulary test for the native speakers? (use the summarise function)

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
```{r eval=FALSE}
summarise(summarydata_enl, mean(Shipley_Voc_Score), sd(Shipley_Voc_Score))
```
mean = 32.1, sd = 3.25
:::

19. Make another variable with the z-scores of the Shipley Vocabulary
    test (see week 1 workbook, 1.4.1.1 Part 1, Task 4). What are the maximum and minimum
    z-scores? (you can use min() and max() in summarise to compute these)?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
```{r eval=FALSE}
summarydata$zshipley <- scale(summarydata$Shipley_Voc_Score)
summarise(summarydata, min(zshipley), max(zshipley))
```
Min: -2.46, max = 1.43
:::

20. Making subgroups of data using group_by function.
Another handy function in the tidyverse library is group_by. This makes subgroups of data
which can then be looked at separately in other functions, such as summarise.
Above, we filtered just the "native" English speakers, but we can specify subgroups of speakers instead.
We make a new object of the grouped data (it looks just the same, but the groups are behind the scenes):

summarydata2 <- group_by(summarydata, english_status)

21. Then we summarise dat2. What is the mean, SD and number of participants for the Shipley_Voc_Score
for the ESL and native English speakers groups?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
```{r eval=FALSE}
summarise(summarydata2, mean(Shipley_Voc_Score), sd(Shipley_Voc_Score), n())
```
english_status `mean(Shipley_Voc_Score)` `sd(Shipley_Voc_Score)` `n()`

1 ESL                                 21.6                    6.76    33

2 native                              32.1                    3.25    42

3 NA                                  30.3                    4.93     6
:::




22. Remember to save your script file as you go along.

#### 3.1.4.4 Part 4: Graphing data

##### Task 5: graphing data using histograms

23. Previously we used plot to draw a scatter plot, and hist to draw a
    histogram. Now, we're going to use ggplot which can draw all kinds
    of graphs, with a great deal more flexibility. We are going to
    represent the data to reflect the following relations:

-   English status and gender
-   Age and vocabulary score
-   Gender and vocabulary score
-   Academic year and vocabulary score
-   Academic year and age
-   English status and vocabulary score
-   English status and age

But first, let's repeat reproducing the histogram from the overhead
slides to look at the distribution of variables:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Gent_1_score)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="blue") + 
  labs(title="Gent Vocabulary Test 1", x = "Vocabulary Score", y = "Frequency")
```

24. Now draw a histogram with Shipley_Voc_Score as the variable and
    colour it orange. Remember to change the title to something
    appropriate.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = summarydata$Shipley_Voc_Score)) + geom_histogram(fill="orange") + labs(title="Shipley Vocabulary Test", x = "Vocabulary Score", y = "Frequency")
```
or how about this for a version that separates out the gender in the same figure:
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Shipley_Voc_Score, fill=Gender )) + geom_histogram(bins = 10) + labs(title="Shipley Vocabulary Test", x = "Vocabulary Score", y = "Frequency")
```
:::


##### Task 6: graphing data using bar graphs

25. Next let's look at English status and gender. What types of variable
    are these? Nominal? Ordinal? Interval/ratio?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
both nominal. So we can only count them.
:::

26. We will draw a bar graph of the counts. We use `geom_bar()` for
    this:

-   First try this:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Gender)) + 
  geom_bar()

```

-   This just draws counts of Gender
-   Now let's draw Gender and English Status together:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Gender, fill = english_status)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

```

Note 1: We use position dodge so that it puts the bars next to each
other (what happens if you leave out `position = dodge`?)

Note 2: We use `fill = english_status` so that it fills the different
bars with different colours according to different english statuses.

What is the general pattern of counts? Are there proportional
differences by English status according to gender?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
proportionally more males who are native English. But we don't (yet) know if that's significant...
:::

##### Task 7: graphing data using scatterplot

27. Next we'll look at Age and Shipley Vocabulary Score. What types of
    data are these?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
interval/ratio, so we can draw a point plot (scatterplot).
:::


28. We will draw a point plot of these values:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Age, y = Shipley_Voc_Score)) + geom_point()

```

We can add
`+ labs(title = "Age by Shipley Vocabulary Score", x = "Age", y = "Shipley Vocabulary Score")`
to tidy up presentation a bit.

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Age, y = Shipley_Voc_Score)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Age by Shipley Vocabulary Score", x = "Age", y = "Shipley Vocabulary Score")

```

-   What is the relation between age and Shipley Vocabulary score?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
it looks positive.
:::

##### Task 8: Draw and interpret a box plot

29. Next on the list of relations to check is gender and vocabulary
    score. Let's look at Gent_1\_score against Gender. What type of
    variables are these?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
one ratio, one nominal, so need a box plot.
:::

30. We will draw a box plot (you could draw a bar graph, but box plots
    tend to be preferred for these combinations of variables - use a bar
    graph for counts):

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Gender, y = Gent_1_score)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 

```

-   Again we can tidy this up by adding labels:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Gender, y = Gent_1_score)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "Vocabulary Score by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Gent Vocabulary Score Test 1")

```

31. Interpreting box plots: The horizontal line indicates the median.
    The box indicates where 50% of the data lie. The lines indicate an
    estimate of the range of the data (minimum and maximum values). The
    dots indicate outliers. A large box indicates larger standard
    deviation. If the boxes don't overlap much then this indicates there
    may be a difference between the groups.

Are there differences in Vocabulary according to gender?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
maybe females slightly lower than males.
:::

32. Now for the other relations:

-   Academic year and vocabulary score
-   Academic year and age
-   English status and vocabulary score
-   English status and age

At the moment, R is interpreting Academic year as a number. We need to
turn it into a nominal variable (called a "factor" in R studio):

```{r eval=FALSE}

summarydata$academic_year <- as.factor(summarydata$academic_year)

```

Draw a graph for each of these relations.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
These are categorical against ratio variables, so all box plots:
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = academic_year, y = Gent_1_score) ) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = academic_year, y = Age) ) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = english_status, y = Gent_1_score) ) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = english_status, y = Age) ) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Age, fill = english_status) ) + geom_histogram()
```
:::

33. Save your R script.

#### 3.4.1.5 Part 5: More practise manipulating data

34.  What are the minimum and maximum values for the ESL and English native speakers?

::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
```{r eval=FALSE}
summarise(summarydata2, min(Shipley_Voc_Score), max(Shipley_Voc_Score))
```
english_status `min(Shipley_Voc_Score)` `max(Shipley_Voc_Score)`
1 ESL                                  10                       38
2 native                               24                       38
3 NA                                   24                       35
:::


#### 3.4.1.6 Part 6: Extending your knowledge

35. An important part of using R-studio is that people share their code, their tutorials,
and help one another out in troubleshooting. Searching for commands and how to use them on
search engines is absolutely fine, and supplementing your learning with others' tutorials is
also what the community does.
Glasgow University psychology department has made some of their course materials available
and so for more practise in using the different data manipulation functions, you could have a look at
[https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-conv/data-wrangling-1.html](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-conv/data-wrangling-1.html)

Ignore the part about making a new R markdown document, use instead an R script.

Just go straight to clear out the environment rm(list=ls()) then load the
