Very glad to have you here!!\nRob Davies  and Padraic Monaghan  are the lecturers on this module.\nWe are looking forward to meeting you!\nThis module is designed for students who have never done data analysis or statistics before, as well as those who have background in this.\nWe have set up the module so that there are different exercises depending on your background.\n\nFor those who are new to data analysis and statistics, there is a week-by-week step-by-step guide to all you need to know to become a masters-level expert in interpreting and analysing psychological data.\nFor those of you who have already used our software (R-studio) for analysis before, after revising the foundations of what you need to know you can move on quickly to the extra explorative exercises where you can hone and broaden your skills.\n\n\n\nSteps to get ready\nHere are the steps to go through before the module begins, to help you prepare for the course:\nFirst: Watch this first video which is a chat between Rob Davies and Padraic Monaghan giving you a bit of an insight into what we’d like you to take from this module and what our philosophy is for teaching.\n\nSecond: Watch this welcome video (part 1) to give you an outline of how this module works:\n\nThird: Then watch this welcome video (part 2) on how to access the software for this module. Basically, what you need to do is in a web browser go to: http://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk and login with your university account name, and your university account password:\n\nNote that you can only access this website from on campus, or via the University’s VPN. For information on connecting to the VPN, see here: ISS help for VPN\n\n\nNext steps\nNext step is to go to the Week 1 materials, once they are released. We aim to release materials for the following week by Thursday of the previous week. You can navigate to the relevant week via the top left corner of the webpage.\n\n\nCourse Contacts\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\n\nPadraic Monaghan\np.monaghan at lancaster dot ac dot uk\n\n\nRob Davies\nr.davies at lancaster dot ac dot uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
