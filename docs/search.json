    "text": "1.4 Practical Materials\n\n1.4.1 Workbook\nIn your group (or on your own until you’ve formed a group), work through this workbook, note any problems and questions you have, and come prepared to the online practical class to go through the tasks and ask your questions.\nIf you’ve done statistics using R-studio before then Parts 1 and 2 will be just revision for you. In which case, Part 3 is where you can focus your work.\nPart 1 of this workbook reproduces what you saw in the week 1 part 3 lecture.\nPart 2 gives you some more exercises in using R studio for finding means, standard deviations, z scores, and drawing histograms.\nPart 3 provides some more extended tasks you can do to practise exploring what R -studio can do and develop your skills further. If you are new to R-studio then parts 1 and 2 cover what you need to know, and Part 3 contains some more extending, optional exercises.\n\n1.4.1.1 Part One: repeat the steps from lecture 1 part 3\n\nTask One: Open Rstudio\n\nStartup Rstudio\n\nTo log in to the R server, first make sure that you have the VPN switched on, or you will need to be connected to the university network (Eduroam). To set up the VPN, follow ISS instructions here or connecting to Eduroam here.\nWhen you are connected, navigate to https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk, where you will be shown a login screen that looks like the below. Click the option that says “Sign in with SAML”.\n \nThis will take you through to the University login screen, where you should enter your username (e.g. ivorym) and then your university password. This will then redirect you to the R server where you can start using RStudio!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have already logged in through the university login already, perhaps to get to the portal, then you may not see the username/password screen. When you click login, you will be redirected straight to RStudio. This is because the server shares the login information securely across the university.\n\n\n\nWhat does RStudio look like?\nWhen RStudio starts, it will look something like this: \nRStudio has three panels or windows: there are tabs for Console (taking up the left hand side), Environment (and History top right), Current file (bottom right). You will also see a 4th window for a script or set of commands you develop, also (on the left hand side).\n\n\n\nTask Two: using the console\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nText that is highlighted with a grey background denotes code, rather than typical prose. Code is different to other forms of writing, such as essays, because the syntax, order and words need to be quite specific. For some longer chunks of code, as you will see below, they are formatted slightly differently.\n\n\n\nIn the “console” part of the R window, next to the &gt;, type 10 + 30. Press return.\n\n\n10 + 30                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you hover your mouse over the box that includes the code snippet, a ‘copy to clipboard’ icon will appear in the top right corner of the box. Click that to copy the code. Now you can easily paste it into your script.\n\n\nIt should give you the answer 40.\n\nIn the console, type a &lt;- 40 and press Return.\n\n\na &lt;- 40                      \n\n\nNow type a and press return. It should give you the answer 40. a is called an object, think of it like a bucket that you can keep a number, or some numbers, or actually all kinds of stuff in.\nNow let’s look at a function, sqrt. sqrt is a function that takes the square root of whatever is inside the brackets. In the console, type sqrt(13). Press Return.\nNow find the square root of the object a by typing sqrt(a). Press return.\n\n\n\n\nTask Three: finding distributions\n\nMake a new object b, and put the following list of children’s attachment scores into it\n\n\nb &lt;- c( 4, 1, 5, 3, 8, 2, 2, 6, 8, 5, 4, 1, 6, 5, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 1, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 4, 8, 6, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 8, 8, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 1, 5, 6, 8, 6, 7, 2, 7)\n\n\nCheck it works by typing b, press return.\nFind the mean of these numbers by typing mean(b).\nFind the median of these numbers by typing median(b).\nFind the standard deviation of these numbers by typing sd(b).\nDraw a histogram of these numbers by typing hist(b).\n\n\n\n\nTask Four: z scores\n\nMake a new object b_z and assign to it the z scores of the values from b:\n\n\nb_z &lt;- scale(b)\n\n\nCheck that it worked by typing b_z.\nDraw a histogram of b_z by typing hist(b_z).\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1.2 Part Two: extra practice\n\nTask Five: investigating distributions\n\nLet’s make three new objects, with the marks from three people’s university masters courses. They are called annie, saj, and carrie and they took 10 courses each. We use the special notation c() to indicate a list, each number in the list is separated by a comma. Type the following into the console:\n\n\nannie &lt;- c(55, 95, 85, 65, 65, 85, 65, 95, 65, 75)\nsaj &lt;- c(65, 85, 95, 75, 65, 55, 55, 75, 95, 85)\ncarrie &lt;- c(75, 65, 95, 95, 55, 85, 75, 55, 95, 55)\n\n\nWho has the highest average (mean) score for their course?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nuse the mean() function\n\n\n\n\n\nWho has the most variable scores for their course?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nuse the sd() function\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the median score for each student?. What does this mean about the distribution of each students’ scores? Use the function hist() to draw the distributions to help you see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nyou can use the summary() function, or the median() function\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Six: standardised scores: Z scores\n\nMake a new object called annie_z and use the function scale to convert annie’s scores to z-scores: in the console type:\n\n\nannie_z &lt;- scale(annie)\n\n\nYou can have a look at the standardised scores of annie, by just typing annie_z. To what did annie’s highest initial score of 95 convert to?\n\n\n\nWhat is the mean and standard deviation of annie_z’s standardised scores?\n\n\n\nDraw a histogram of annie’s standardised scores, in the console type hist(annie_z). What is the peak frequency value?\n\n\n\nBonus extra: If you want to find out the proportion of scores lower than a particular score you can do it like this in R-studio: pnorm(x) where x is the z-score you’re interested in. What is the proportion of scores lower than annie’s highest grade score?\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1.3 Part Three: Extras\nIf you’ve whizzed through the previous tasks, then you can move on to the following activities to explore further the functionality of R studio.\n\nTask Seven: Exploring operators.\nSo far, we’ve just looked at + as an operator. Go to this page: https://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html\n\nIn the console, assign the object d to be 100 multiplied by 246.\nIn the console, assign the object e to be 84 divided by 32.1.\nAssign the variable f to 8 to the power of 4 (in R this is called exponentiation).\nWhat is the result of d added to e all divided by f\n\n\n\n\nTask Eight: Exploring functions\nSo far, we’ve just looked at the square root function sqrt(). Go to this page: https://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html\n\nWhat is the result of abs(-5.3)? What does the abs function do?\n\n\n\nUsing the seq() function, generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 30 in intervals of 3.\nAssign the sequence generated in step 28 to a new object. Now compute the mean of the sequence of numbers. (remember that objects can be a single number, or a sequence of numbers (called an array or a vector) or anything you want to put into it – remember, think of objects as buckets).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStuck? Here’s the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nTry out the following code, pay special attention to how the sentences above “convert” into R code.\n\nsequence &lt;- seq(0,30, 3)\nmean(sequence)\n\n\n\n\n\nAssign the sequence generated in 31 to a new object. Now compute the mean of the sequence of numbers. (remember that objects can be a single number, or a sequence of numbers (called an array or a vector) or anything you want to put into it – remember, think of objects as buckets).\n\n\n\n\nTask Nine: Exploring others’ data\nHave a look at this article: Scullin, M. K., Gao, C., & Fillmore, P. (2021). Bedtime music, involuntary musical imagery, and sleep. Psychological Science, 32(7), 985-997. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797621989724\nAbstract Many people listen to music for hours every day, often near bedtime. We investigated whether music listening affects sleep, focusing on a rarely explored mechanism: involuntary musical imagery (earworms). In Study 1 (N = 199, mean age = 35.9 years), individuals who frequently listen to music reported persistent nighttime earworms, which were associated with worse sleep quality. In Study 2 (N = 50, mean age = 21.2 years), we randomly assigned each participant to listen to lyrical or instrumental-only versions of popular songs before bed in a laboratory, discovering that instrumental music increased the incidence of nighttime earworms and worsened polysomnography-measured sleep quality. In both studies, earworms were experienced during awakenings, suggesting that the sleeping brain continues to process musical melodies. Study 3 substantiated this possibility by showing a significant increase in frontal slow oscillation activity, a marker of sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Thus, some types of music can disrupt nighttime sleep by inducing long-lasting earworms that are perpetuated by spontaneous memory-reactivation processes.\nThe data from the study is available on this osf website. The data we will look at is from the first study, the data set called “Earworm_MTurk_OSF.sav” on the osf site. These data are saved in spss format, which is not great for R-studio. We can still read it in, though, using a function called spss.get()\n\nBrowse the paper to see what it is about. Focus on Study 1.\nFrom the osf website download the data file: Earworm_MTurk_OSF.sav, and also download the codebook file: Earworm_MTurk_Codebook.xlsx. The codebook tells you what each of the measures are in the data file.\nLoad the data into R-studio: in the bottom right panel of R-studio, click on Upload, and browse to the Earworm_MTurk_OSF.sav file. It should then appear in the list of files in that bottom right panel.\nThat step means we can access the data, but it isn’t yet loaded into R-studio.\n\nSo, next load the data file into R-studio so we can work on it. You might have noticed that the data file is in SPSS format (that’s what the .sav ending to the file means). But, we can still load that in to R-studio.\nTo do that first, load the library Hmisc: library(Hmisc)\n\nlibrary(Hmisc)\n\n\nThen, use the function spss.get():\n\n\ndat &lt;- spss.get(\"Earworm_MTurk_OSF.sav\")\n\n\nThat should have made you a new object in R-studio called “dat” which contains the data from the study.\nNext, we can have a look at the data. Here are a few questions to get you going:\n\n\nHow many male, how many female participants?\n\n\n\nHow many people never have earworms in the middle of the night?\n\n\n\nFor the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, how many participants felt “Somewhat foggy, let down”?\n\n\n\nWhat was the mean, SD and range of age of the participants? Does your calculation of mean age correspond to that given in the paper?\n\n\n\nCan you work out the mean age of the male and female participants separately?\n\n\n\nExplore the data, see if you can remember tasks for separating different subgroups, graphing relations, comparing groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Data\n(There are no data that you need for today’s practical, other than the link to the data for the earworm study, but when there are data sets you need, you will find them in this data section.)\n\n\n1.4.3 Answers\nThe answers to the workbook will appear below each question in the workbook, above, after the practical has finished, so you can check your answers.\nIt’s really important for your learning that you have a go first of all at the workbook before looking at the answers.",
