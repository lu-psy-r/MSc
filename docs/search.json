Basically, what you need to do is in a web browser go to: http://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk and login with your university account name, and your university account password:\n\nNote that you can only access this website from on campus, or via the University’s VPN. For information on connecting to the VPN, see here: ISS help for VPN\n\n\nNext steps\nNext step is to go to the Week 1 materials, once they are released.

In which case, Part 3 is where you can focus your work.\nPart 1 of this workbook reproduces what you saw in the week 1 part 3 lecture.\nPart 2 gives you some more exercises in using R studio for finding means, standard deviations, z scores, and drawing histograms.\nPart 3 provides some more extended tasks you can do to practise exploring what R -studio can do and develop your skills further. If you are new to R-studio then parts 1 and 2 cover what you need to know, and Part 3 contains some more extending, optional exercises.\n\n1.4.1.1 Part One: repeat the steps from lecture 1 part 3\n\nTask One: Open Rstudio\n\nStartup Rstudio\n\nTo log in to the R server, first make sure that you have the VPN switched on, or you will need to be connected to the university network (Eduroam). To set up the VPN, follow ISS instructions here or connecting to Eduroam here.\nWhen you are connected, navigate to https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk, where you will be shown a login screen that looks like the below. Click the option that says “Sign in with SAML”.\n\nThis will take you through to the University login screen, where you should enter your username (e.g. ivorym) and then your university password. This will then redirect you to the R server where you can start using RStudio!",
