The research hypothesis is: “People who identify as male or female have different vocabulary scores”. What is the null hypothesis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no difference between people who self-identify as male or female on vocabulary scores.\n\n\n\n\nTo test the research hypothesis, we will filter people who self-identify as male or female from the data set. To be inclusive, additional research questions would be part of your research project to analyse also people who self-identify as other gender. Run this command to extract a subset of the data (note that the | stands for “or”, and means Gender matches male or gender matches female:\n\n\ndat2 &lt;- filter(dat, Gender == 'Male' | Gender == 'Female')\n\n\nDraw a box plot of Gent vocabulary test 1 scores by gender. For a box plot, note that we need data in “long format”, where each observation is on one line, and we have a column that indicates which condition (in this case Gender) the participant is in. Does it look like there might be a gender effect? What is the direction of the effect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wk4/PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_24.csv\")\n\nRows: 270 Columns: 8\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (2): english_status, Gender\ndbl (6): subject_ID, Age, Shipley_Voc_Score, Gent_1_score, Gent_2_score, aca...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# remember to change academic year to be a nominal/categorical variable, rather than a number:\ndat$academic_year &lt;- as.factor(dat$academic_year)\ndat2 &lt;- filter(dat, Gender == 'Male' | Gender == 'Female')\nggplot(dat2, aes(x = Gender, y = Gent_1_score)) + geom_boxplot()\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph indicates that maybe males are slightly higher, but looks like a lot of overlap.\n\n\n\n\nNote that unless we had filtered the data, the box plot would contain ‘NA’ as well, which stands for missing data. In a data set it’s always a good idea to call missing data ‘NA’ rather than just leaving them blank because this could be interpreted as a zero or as an error of filling in data. Missing values make things untidy, so it’s good practice to focus only on the variables we need for the t-test and remove all other missing values. Use select() to get just the Gender and Gent_1_score variables, and put this in a new object called ‘dat3’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat3 &lt;- select(dat2, Gender, Gent_1_score)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, in order to run a t-test we have to remove any rows of data which contain a ‘NA’ - either in the Gender or the Gent_1_score variables. We do this using drop_na(dat3), put the result in a new object called ‘dat4’. Run this command:\n\n\ndat4 &lt;- drop_na(dat3)\n\n\nNow, redraw the box plot from Step 21. Check there are just two groups still.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat3 &lt;- select(dat2, Gender, Gent_1_score)\ndat4 &lt;- drop_na(dat3)\nggplot(dat2, aes(x = Gender, y = Gent_1_score)) + geom_boxplot()\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, two groups.\n\n\n\n\nCompute mean and SDs for people who self-identify as male or female on Gent vocabulary test 1 scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse group_by() and summarise().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat5 &lt;- group_by(dat4, Gender)\nsummarise(dat5, mean(Gent_1_score), sd(Gent_1_score))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  Gender `mean(Gent_1_score)` `sd(Gent_1_score)`\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Female                 58.6               14.0\n2 Male                   62.2               14.5\n\n# Or, if you know how to use the %&gt;% (pipe) ...:\ndat4 %&gt;% group_by(Gender) %&gt;% summarise(mean(Gent_1_score), sd(Gent_1_score))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  Gender `mean(Gent_1_score)` `sd(Gent_1_score)`\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Female                 58.6               14.0\n2 Male                   62.2               14.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Run the independent t-test and measure effect size\n\nConduct an independent t-test using this command:\n\n\nt.test(Gent_1_score ~ Gender, data = dat4 ) \n\n\n\n‘Gent_1_score ~ Gender’ : the ~ can be interpreted as ‘by’, i.e., compute Gent_1_score by Gender\n\n\nThe results should look like this, do yours?\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  Gent_1_score by Gender\nt = -1.6693, df = 83.298, p-value = 0.09881\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Female and group Male is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -7.982423  0.697279\nsample estimates:\nmean in group Female   mean in group Male \n            58.57561             62.21818 \n\nThe key part of the results to look at is the one that has t = -1.6693, df = 83.298, p-value = 0.09881. This is the result that you report: t(83.30) = -1.67, p = .099.\n\nThe value is negative because the function includes Female before Male - and Female score is lower than Male score. What matters is how far away from zero the t-test is (either positively or negatively). The df value is slightly odd because the t.test() function figures out degrees of freedom in a technical way which takes into account differences in variance in the data between the two groups. We can just use the value that the t.test() function gives us.\n\nIs this a significant difference?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, it isn’t. The p-value is greater than 0.05.\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to compute the effect size, using Cohen’s d. You need to load the library lsr then use this command:\n\n\ncohensD(Gent_1_score ~ Gender, method = \"unequal\", data = dat4)\n\n\nIt’s pretty much the same as the t-test() command except that we use ‘method = ’unequal’. For a paired t-test you would use ‘method = ’paired’\n\n\nWhat is the effect size? Make a brief report of the results - reporting means and SDs, the t-test, p-value, and Cohen’s d. Discuss your brief report in your group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nd = 0.27\nAn ideal brief report of the results would state what the research question/hypothesis is, describe the means and SDs of the groups being compared, and then report the t-test statistic, with p-value and Cohen’s d effect size, then provide a brief interpretation of what the results mean.\nBased on Hyde and Linn (1988), we hypothesised that people who self-identify as female may score slightly higher than males in terms of vocabulary scores. Males (mean = 62.2, SD = 14.5) scored higher than females (mean = 58.6, SD = 14.0) on the first time participants attempted the Gent vocabulary test, however this difference was not significant, t(83.30) = -1.67, p = .099, Cohen’s d = 0.27. We did not find evidence to support the hypothesis.\nReference\nHyde, J. S., & Linn, M. C. (1988). Gender differences in verbal ability: A meta-analysis.

What is the research hypothesis and the null hypothesis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Hypothesis: People who speak English as a native language have higher vocabulary scores than those with English as a second language.\nNull Hypothesis: There is no difference in vocabulary scores between native English and second language English speakers.\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the Steps 22-30 in Tasks 2 and 3 except using english_status in place of Gender throughout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat &lt;- read.csv(\"data/wk4/PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_24.csv\")\ndat2 &lt;- select(dat, english_status, Gent_1_score)\ndat3 &lt;- drop_na(dat2)\nggplot(dat3, aes(x = english_status, y = Gent_1_score)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat4 &lt;- group_by(dat3, english_status)\nsummarise(dat4, mean(Gent_1_score), sd(Gent_1_score), n())\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  english_status `mean(Gent_1_score)` `sd(Gent_1_score)` `n()`\n  &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 ESL                            49.1              15.3     95\n2 native                         65.2               9.36   163\n\nt.test(Gent_1_score ~ english_status, data = dat3 )\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  Gent_1_score by english_status\nt = -9.2983, df = 135.56, p-value = 3.256e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group ESL and group native is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -19.57080 -12.70599\nsample estimates:\n   mean in group ESL mean in group native \n            49.09474             65.23313 \n\ncohensD(Gent_1_score ~ english_status, method = \"unequal\", data = dat3 )\n\n[1] 1.27044\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a brief report of the results, including means and SDs for native speakers and ESL speakers, t-test, p-value, and Cohen’s d. Discuss your report in your group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nWe hypothesised that English as an additional language would result in lower overall vocabulary scores than English as a first language, because of the relation between length of time learning a language and language skills (Davies et al., 2017). Native English speakers (mean = 65.4, SD = 9.8) scored significantly higher on the Gent vocabulary test than speakers of English as a second language (mean = 48.3, SD = 15.7), t(127.79) = -9.08, p &lt; .001, Cohen’s d = 1.30, a large effect size. Thus, the hypothesis was supported, with native English speakers scoring significantly higher on the Gent vocabulary test than those with English as an additional language.\nReference\nDavies, R. A.

Data from, “Web-based Positive Psychology Interventions: A Reexamination of Effectiveness”. Journal of Open Psychology Data, 6(1).\n\nOur research question is whether happiness scores are affected by the interventions.

So, we need a slightly different version of the data, which you can download here for the ahicesd.csv file and here for the participantinfo2.csv file.\n\nRemind yourself what these data mean.\n\nOnce again, join the ahicesd.csv and participantinfo2.csv data in R-studio by aligning the names for the participant numbers in these two data sets (see week 2 workbook for reminders about this).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndat &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wk5/ahicesd.csv\")\n\nRows: 992 Columns: 50\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (50): id, occasion, elapsed.days, intervention, ahi01, ahi02, ahi03, ahi...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\npinfo &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wk5/participantinfo2.csv\")\n\nNew names:\nRows: 147 Columns: 7\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" dbl\n(7): ...1, id, intervention, sex, age, educ, income\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -&gt; `...1`\n\nall_dat &lt;- inner_join(x = dat, y = pinfo, by = c(\"id\", \"intervention\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s select only the relevant variables. Use select() to select only id, ahiTotal, and occasion variables, and save this as a new object called ‘summarydata’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummarydata &lt;- select(all_dat, c(\"id\", \"ahiTotal\", \"occasion\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nUse filter to pull out only occasion == 0 or occasion == 1 scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nuse occasion == 0 | occasion == 1'), save this as a new object called summarydata2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummarydata2 &lt;- filter(summarydata, occasion == 0 | occasion == 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is where we would usually remove all the NA values, but there aren’t any in this file (so we don’t need drop_na()).\nNow, we need to make sure occasion is treated as a categorical variable, rather than a continuous variable, so we need to convert it to a factor:\n\n\nsummarydata2$occasion &lt;-as.factor(summarydata2$occasion)\n\n\nNow, draw a box plot of ahiTotal scores by occasion (why do we use a box plot?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(summarydata2, aes(x = occasion, y = ahiTotal)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use a boxplot because we have one nominal/categorical variable and one interval/ratio/ordinal measure.\n\n\n\n\nCompute mean and SD for each occasion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(summarydata2, aes(x = occasion, y = ahiTotal)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to run the paired t-test, we first need to make sure that the paired values (in this case the measures from the same person) are on the same row of the data. So, let’s use pivot_wider to put the ahiTotal scores for occasion 0 in one column, and the ahiTotal scores for occasion 1 in another column:\n\n\nsummarydata2_wide &lt;- pivot_wider(summarydata2, names_from = occasion, values_from = ahiTotal, names_prefix = \"occasion_\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we use the names_prefix = “occasion_” as an extra argument to make the column names “occasion_0” and “occasion_1”.\nWhat would happen if we didn’t use names_prefix? It would still work, but it’s a bit more awkward to work with the output.\n\n\n\n\nThen, we can run the paired t-test in the following way:\n\n\nt.test(summarydata2_wide$occasion_0, summarydata2_wide$occasion_1, paired = TRUE)\n\nIs the result significant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nyes, because p &lt; .05.\n\n\n\n\nNow run Cohen’s d: it’s similar to the way we do the paired t-test:\n\n\ncohensD( summarydata2_wide$occasion_0, summarydata2_wide$occasion_1, method =  \"paired\")\n\nWhat is the value for Cohen’s d?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nd = 0.4059904\n\n\n\n\nWrite up a brief report of the result and discuss in your group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tested whether participants’ happiness scores at first testing after the interventions were different than their scores prior to the interventions. We found that, prior to the intervention, scores were significantly lower (M = 69.3, SD = 12.3) than they were immediately after the interventions (M = 72.4, SD = 12.6), t(146) = = 4.92, p &lt; .001, Cohen’s d = 0.41, a medium effect. The results indicate that the intervention had a positive effect on happiness scores.\n\n\n\n\nSave your R script file.\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1.4 Part 4: More practise running a paired t-test\nWe are going to figure out whether people have different scores the first and second time they take the Gent vocabulary test.\n\nGo back to the vocabulary scores data. Load the data into dat, and make another object dat2 that contains only the subject_ID, Gent_1_score and Gent_2_score.\nSome people did not do all the tests - look at participant 46 for instance. To do a t-test we need data where the person does both tests. We can filter out the scores where there are no NAs by repeating the drop_na we did at step 23, above. Call the new data object dat3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat &lt;- read.csv(\"data/wk4/PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_24.csv\"); \ndat$academic_year &lt;- as.factor(dat$academic_year)\ndat2 &lt;- select(dat, subject_ID, Gent_1_score, Gent_2_score)\ndat3 &lt;- drop_na(dat2)\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the paired t-test.\n\nEach row contains a score for each person for each Gent test, and so we are ready to run the paired t-test:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.test(dat3$Gent_1_score, dat3$Gent_2_score, paired = TRUE)\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  dat3$Gent_1_score and dat3$Gent_2_score\nt = -2.2126, df = 246, p-value = 0.02784\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -2.4488231 -0.1422701\nsample estimates:\nmean of the differences \n              -1.295547 \n\ncohensD( dat3$Gent_1_score, dat3$Gent_2_score, , method =  \"paired\")\n\n[1] 0.1407865\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet mean and SD of the scores for the tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummarise(dat3, mean(Gent_1_score), sd(Gent_1_score), mean(Gent_2_score), sd(Gent_2_score))\n\n  mean(Gent_1_score) sd(Gent_1_score) mean(Gent_2_score) sd(Gent_2_score)\n1           59.16194         13.99441           60.45749         14.89002\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to draw a box plot of the Gent vocabulary scores taken at the first and second occasion, we will need the data in “long format”, so that there is a column saying which test it is and a column reporting the scores on the Gent tests.

A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backwards as forwards (e.g., abba, rotavator).\nI would like to know if being a palindrome or not affects processing of the words. My prediction is that being a palindrome helps access the word.\nWhat you will need to do is apply a function called “palindrome” to the words in the de Zubicaray dataset, to make a new variable, called or some other name then run a multiple regression with all the other variables plus this one.\nHere is a script with the function called palindrome included, with some comments to show how it is put into practice. You will need to add the function into the top of an analysis script (e.g., rmd or r script) file and make sure that is loaded along with the other commands you are using.",

If you used read_sav then these issues don’t apply. But for get.spss, in particular, the ratings of happiness are a bit all over the place. (this is because get.spss keeps information about responses but also what those responses mean and sometimes mixes them up together). We want these to just be numbers, 1,2,3,4, but instead they have the coding for what the numbers mean as well. If you’ve loaded in your data set into an object called “dat”: then the following lines will work to tidy things up:\n\n\ndat$PracticeHappy &lt;- gsub(\"\\n1=not happy at all\\n\", \"1\", dat$PracticeHappy)\ndat$PracticeHappy &lt;- gsub(\"\\n2=a bit happy\\n\", \"2\", dat$PracticeHappy)\ndat$PracticeHappy &lt;- gsub(\"\\n3=quite happy\\n\", \"3\", dat$PracticeHappy)\ndat$PracticeHappy &lt;- gsub(\"\\n4=very happy\\n\", \"4\", dat$PracticeHappy)\ndat$PracticeHappy &lt;- as.numeric(dat$PracticeHappy)\ndat$VideoHappy &lt;- gsub(\"\\n1=not happy at all\\n\", \"1\", dat$VideoHappy)\ndat$VideoHappy &lt;- gsub(\"\\n2=a bit happy\\n\", \"2\", dat$VideoHappy)\ndat$VideoHappy &lt;- gsub(\"\\n3=quite happy\\n\", \"3\", dat$VideoHappy)\ndat$VideoHappy &lt;- gsub(\"\\n4=very happy\\n\", \"4\", dat$VideoHappy)\ndat$VideoHappy &lt;- as.numeric(dat$VideoHappy)\n\n\nNow, you can look at plotting the happiness ratings at baseline against happiness ratings after the children watch the video. You can also look at the means and standard deviations of the ratings to see if there is a numerical difference. What are the means and SDs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember: You will need to load in the tidyverse library at this stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nplot(dat$PracticeHappy, dat$VideoHappy)\nsummarise(dat, mean(PracticeHappy), sd(PracticeHappy), mean(VideoHappy, na.rm=T), sd(VideoHappy, na.rm=T))\n\nmean(PracticeHappy) sd(PracticeHappy) mean(VideoHappy, na.rm = T) sd(VideoHappy, na.rm = T)\n1 2.638889 0.7822321 1.983051 0.828982\nor you could use:\n\nmean(dat$PracticeHappy); sd(dat$PracticeHappy); mean(dat$VideoHappy); sd(dat$VideoHappy)\n\n\n\n\n\nLater in the workbook, we use the functions group_by and summarise, so you could use these to look at the means separately for the emotion conditions (EmotionCondition) - how would you do that? What are the means and SDs? What effect does there seem to be of the emotion conditions on happiness mood change? If you don’t yet know how to do this, then come back to it after you’ve completed the rest of the workbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat2 &lt;- group_by(dat, EmotionCondition)\nsummarise(dat2, mean(PracticeHappy), sd(PracticeHappy), mean(VideoHappy, na.rm=T), sd(VideoHappy, na.rm=T))\n\nEmotionCondition mean(PracticeHappy) sd(PracticeHappy) mean(VideoHappy, na.rm = T) sd(VideoHappy, na.rm = T)\n1 Awe 2.68 0.800 2.08 0.747\n2 Joy 2.5 0.701 2.22 0.956\n3 Control 2.74 0.835 1.62 0.648\nhappiness decreases in all conditions, but most for Control, mid for Awe, least for Joy conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Reproduce the Lecture week3 part3 analyses\n\nTask 2: Load in the data, draw a histogram, find means and standard deviations\n\nCreate a new r script, called psyc411_week3.r, and clear out R studio ready for a new script using rm(list=ls()).\nDownload the data files from last week once again on the vocabulary tests here: PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv.\nLoad the data into an object called “dat” using read_csv(), what command line do you use? (remember to set the working directory)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat &lt;- read_csv(\"PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nView the data. What command do you use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView(dat)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make a histogram of the first time people took the Gent vocabulary test:\n\n\nhist(dat$Gent_1_score)\n\n\nAnd a histogram of the second time people took the Gent test, what command line do you use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist(dat$Gent_2_score)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use a function called summarise. This is more powerful than just using mean(dat$Gent_1_score) and sd(dat$Gent_1_score), etc. because it can give us summary statistics on subgroups of data, and can give us much more than just means and SDs. Have a look at the documentation for the function:\n\n\n?summarise\n\nWe use it like this: first put the object that the variables are in, then tell summarise what to do with each variable - eg compute the mean or sd or number of times it’s measured (that’s the n() part), or whatever:\nsummarise(dat, mean(Gent_1_score), sd(Gent_1_score), mean(Gent_2_score), sd(Gent_2_score), n())\nHowever, this won’t have worked - it will just say NA for means and SDs. This is because summarise doesn’t work if there are missing values (called NA). So, we have to tell summarise to ignore the NAs.\nsummarise(dat, mean(Gent_1_score, na.rm=T), sd(Gent_1_score, na.rm=T), mean(Gent_2_score, na.rm=T), sd(Gent_2_score, na.rm=T), n())\nWhat is the mean and standard deviation of Gent_1_score and Gent_2_score?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummarise(dat, mean(Gent_1_score, na.rm=T), sd(Gent_1_score, na.rm=T), mean(Gent_2_score, na.rm=T), sd(Gent_2_score, na.rm=T), n())\n\nmean(Gent_1_score, na.rm = T) sd(Gent_1_score, na.rm = T) mean(Gent_2_score, na.rm = T) sd(Gent_2_score, na-rm= T) n()\n57.4 16.0 57.1 18.7 81\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Use ggplot to draw some histograms:\n\nNow we are going to use another way of making graphs. This is more flexible than the hist function. Here is how to make a histogram of the Gent vocabulary scores:\n\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = Gent_1_score) ) + geom_histogram(fill=\"blue\") + labs(title=\"Gent Vocabulary Test 1\", x = \"Vocabulary Score\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\nAnd for the second Gent test:\n\n\nggplot(dat, aes(x = Gent_2_score) ) + geom_histogram(fill=\"red\") + labs(title=\"Gent Vocabulary Test 2\", x = \"Vocabulary Score\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBreaking it down:\nggplot(dat, aes(x = Gent_1_score)): this calls the plotting function ggplot\ndat: we specify the data set we will use\nand we set the data for the plot, in this case we say that the x value (so that’s what will be along the x-axis in the graph) is the Gent_1_score. We put this inside aes(), which stands for “aesthetic”.\n+ geom_histogram(fill=\"blue\"): this adds a graph of type histogram and colours it blue\n+ labs(title=\"Gent Vocabulary Test\", x = \"Vocabulary Score\", y = \"Frequency\"): this adds labels to the graph: title, the x-axis label and the y-axis label.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3.3 Part 3: Practise manipulating data\n\nTask 4: Practise manipulating data\n\nLet’s keep only some of the variables from the dataset dat - let’s remove Gender_code, and Dyslexia_diagnosis. Keep the other variables using select() and load this into summarydata\n\n\nsummarydata &lt;- select(dat, subject_ID, Age, english_status, Gender, Shipley_Voc_Score, Gent_1_score, Gent_2_score, academic_year)\n\n\nNext we will have a bit more of a wander around the data to get a feel for it. We will first use the function arrange(), which changes the order of observations (rows):\n\n\narrange(summarydata, Shipley_Voc_Score)\n\nWhat is the lowest score of a participant on the Shipley Vocabulary questionnaire? (You may like to make a new object, which is the result of the arrange function, then look at it in View).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to order from highest to lowest, you have to use the desc() function:\n\n\narrange(summarydata, desc(Shipley_Voc_Score))\n\nWhat is the highest value on the Shipley Vocabulary Test? How many participants have this highest score?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n38, 2 participants\n\n\n\n\nNext we will use the filter() function. This includes or excludes certain observations (rows). Let’s just include the participants with English as a first language and put this into a new object, called summarydata_enl.\n\n\nsummarydata_enl &lt;- filter(summarydata, english_status == 'native')\n\nWhat are the mean and SD values of the Shipley Vocabulary test for the native speakers? (use the summarise function)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummarise(summarydata_enl, mean(Shipley_Voc_Score), sd(Shipley_Voc_Score))\n\nmean = 32.1, sd = 3.25\n\n\n\n\nMake another variable with the z-scores of the Shipley Vocabulary test (see week 1 workbook, 1.4.1.1 Part 1, Task 4). What are the maximum and minimum z-scores? (you can use min() and max() in summarise to compute these)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummarydata$zshipley &lt;- scale(summarydata$Shipley_Voc_Score)\nsummarise(summarydata, min(zshipley), max(zshipley))\n\nMin: -2.46, max = 1.43\n\n\n\n\nMaking subgroups of data using group_by function. Another handy function in the tidyverse library is group_by. This makes subgroups of data which can then be looked at separately in other functions, such as summarise. Above, we filtered just the “native” English speakers, but we can specify subgroups of speakers instead. We make a new object of the grouped data (it looks just the same, but the groups are behind the scenes):\n\nsummarydata2 &lt;- group_by(summarydata, english_status)\n\nThen we summarise dat2. What is the mean, SD and number of participants for the Shipley_Voc_Score for the ESL and native English speakers groups?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummarise(summarydata2, mean(Shipley_Voc_Score), sd(Shipley_Voc_Score), n())\n\nenglish_status mean(Shipley_Voc_Score) sd(Shipley_Voc_Score) n()\n1 ESL 21.6 6.76 33\n2 native 32.1 3.25 42\n3 NA 30.3 4.93 6\n\n\n\n\nRemember to save your script file as you go along.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4.4 Part 4: Graphing data\n\nTask 5: graphing data using histograms\n\nPreviously we used plot to draw a scatter plot, and hist to draw a histogram. Now, we’re going to use ggplot which can draw all kinds of graphs, with a great deal more flexibility. We are going to represent the data to reflect the following relations:\n\n\nEnglish status and gender\nAge and vocabulary score\nGender and vocabulary score\nAcademic year and vocabulary score\nAcademic year and age\nEnglish status and vocabulary score\nEnglish status and age\n\nBut first, let’s repeat reproducing the histogram from the overhead slides to look at the distribution of variables:\n\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Gent_1_score)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill=\"blue\") + \n  labs(title=\"Gent Vocabulary Test 1\", x = \"Vocabulary Score\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\nNow draw a histogram with Shipley_Voc_Score as the variable and colour it orange. Remember to change the title to something appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x = summarydata$Shipley_Voc_Score)) + geom_histogram(fill=\"orange\") + labs(title=\"Shipley Vocabulary Test\", x = \"Vocabulary Score\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\nor how about this for a version that separates out the gender in the same figure:\n\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Shipley_Voc_Score, fill=Gender )) + geom_histogram(bins = 10) + labs(title=\"Shipley Vocabulary Test\", x = \"Vocabulary Score\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 6: graphing data using bar graphs\n\nNext let’s look at English status and gender. What types of variable are these? Nominal? Ordinal? Interval/ratio?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nboth nominal. So we can only count them.\n\n\n\n\nWe will draw a bar graph of the counts. We use geom_bar() for this:\n\n\nFirst try this:\n\n\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Gender)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\nThis just draws counts of Gender\nNow let’s draw Gender and English Status together:\n\n\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Gender, fill = english_status)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\nNote 1: We use position dodge so that it puts the bars next to each other (what happens if you leave out position = dodge?)\nNote 2: We use fill = english_status so that it fills the different bars with different colours according to different english statuses.\nWhat is the general pattern of counts? Are there proportional differences by English status according to gender?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nproportionally more males who are native English. But we don’t (yet) know if that’s significant…\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 7: graphing data using scatterplot\n\nNext we’ll look at Age and Shipley Vocabulary Score. What types of data are these?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\ninterval/ratio, so we can draw a point plot (scatterplot).\n\n\n\n\nWe will draw a point plot of these values:\n\n\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Age, y = Shipley_Voc_Score)) + geom_point()\n\nWe can add + labs(title = \"Age by Shipley Vocabulary Score\", x = \"Age\", y = \"Shipley Vocabulary Score\") to tidy up presentation a bit.\n\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Age, y = Shipley_Voc_Score)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(title = \"Age by Shipley Vocabulary Score\", x = \"Age\", y = \"Shipley Vocabulary Score\")\n\n\nWhat is the relation between age and Shipley Vocabulary score?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nit looks positive.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 8: Draw and interpret a box plot\n\nNext on the list of relations to check is gender and vocabulary score. Let’s look at Gent_1_score against Gender. What type of variables are these?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\none ratio, one nominal, so need a box plot.\n\n\n\n\nWe will draw a box plot (you could draw a bar graph, but box plots tend to be preferred for these combinations of variables - use a bar graph for counts):\n\n\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Gender, y = Gent_1_score)) + \n  geom_boxplot() \n\n\nAgain we can tidy this up by adding labels:\n\n\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Gender, y = Gent_1_score)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = \"Vocabulary Score by Gender\", x = \"Gender\", y = \"Gent Vocabulary Score Test 1\")\n\n\nInterpreting box plots: The horizontal line indicates the median. The box indicates where 50% of the data lie. The lines indicate an estimate of the range of the data (minimum and maximum values). The dots indicate outliers. A large box indicates larger standard deviation. If the boxes don’t overlap much then this indicates there may be a difference between the groups.\n\nAre there differences in Vocabulary according to gender?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nmaybe females slightly lower than males.\n\n\n\n\nNow for the other relations:\n\n\nAcademic year and vocabulary score\nAcademic year and age\nEnglish status and vocabulary score\nEnglish status and age\n\nAt the moment, R is interpreting Academic year as a number. We need to turn it into a nominal variable (called a “factor” in R studio):\n\nsummarydata$academic_year &lt;- as.factor(summarydata$academic_year)\n\nDraw a graph for each of these relations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are categorical against ratio variables, so all box plots:\n\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x = academic_year, y = Gent_1_score) ) + geom_boxplot()\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x = academic_year, y = Age) ) + geom_boxplot()\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x = english_status, y = Gent_1_score) ) + geom_boxplot()\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x = english_status, y = Age) ) + geom_boxplot()\nggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Age, fill = english_status) ) + geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\nSave your R script.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.5 Part 5: More practise manipulating data\n\nWhat are the minimum and maximum values for the ESL and English native speakers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummarise(summarydata2, min(Shipley_Voc_Score), max(Shipley_Voc_Score))\n\nenglish_status min(Shipley_Voc_Score) max(Shipley_Voc_Score) 1 ESL 10 38 2 native 24 38 3 NA 24 35\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.6 Part 6: Extending your knowledge\n\nAn important part of using R-studio is that people share their code, their tutorials, and help one another out in troubleshooting. Searching for commands and how to use them on search engines is absolutely fine, and supplementing your learning with others’ tutorials is also what the community does. Glasgow University psychology department has made some of their course materials available and so for more practise in using the different data manipulation functions, you could have a look at https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-conv/data-wrangling-1.html\n\nIgnore the part about making a new R markdown document, use instead an R script.\nJust go straight to clear out the environment rm(list=ls()) then load the libraries tidyverse() and babynames() where the babynames() library contains the database on babies’ names that you can explore in the example (you’ll need to install.packages(“babynames”) first).\nAnd then begin at Section “4.4: Activity 2: Look at the data”.\n\nFor the data that you downloaded from the papers for your extra exercises in weeks 1 and 2, construct some graphs to show relations between variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUse geom_bar() for bar graphs of counts Use geom_box() for box plots showing means Use geom_point() to show relations between two or more variables Use geom_histogram() to show distributions of one or more variables\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.7 Part 7: Extending everyone’s knowledge (Optional extra)\nIf you want a real challenge, where we can get to the boundary of doing some original research, then here is another optional extra:\nThis is a recently published paper that draws on lots of different sources of secondary data. It is a really impressive example of what you can do with already existing data.\nThis is from the study de Zubicaray, G. I., Kearney, E., Guenther, F., McMahon, K. L., & Arciuli, J. (2024). Statistical relationships between surface form and sensory meanings of English words influence lexical processing. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, in press.\nMy challenge to you is to get all the datasets together that this paper refers to, and see if you can repeat the first analysis in their paper. They actually have the r scripts (in this case they are r-markdown (.rmd) files) as well as the data available.\nIf you can do that, then I will be amazed and impressed, and then I’ve got another task for you, which you’ll have to ask me for in the practical.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Data\nHere is a link to the data referred to in this practical:\n\nPSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Answers\nThe answers to the workbook now appear below each question in the workbook, above, after the practical has finished, so you can check your work.\nIt’s really important for your learning that you have a go first of all at the workbook before looking at the answers.\n&lt;!—- ## 3.5 Extras",

    "text": "1.4 Practical Materials\n\n1.4.1 Workbook\nIn your group (or on your own until you’ve formed a group), work through this workbook, note any problems and questions you have, and come prepared to the online practical class to go through the tasks and ask your questions.\nIf you’ve done statistics using R-studio before then Parts 1 and 2 will be just revision for you. In which case, Part 3 is where you can focus your work.\nPart 1 of this workbook reproduces what you saw in the week 1 part 3 lecture.\nPart 2 gives you some more exercises in using R studio for finding means, standard deviations, z scores, and drawing histograms.\nPart 3 provides some more extended tasks you can do to practise exploring what R -studio can do and develop your skills further. If you are new to R-studio then parts 1 and 2 cover what you need to know, and Part 3 contains some more extending, optional exercises.\n\n1.4.1.1 Part One: repeat the steps from lecture 1 part 3\n\nTask One: Open Rstudio\n\nStartup Rstudio\n\nTo log in to the R server, first make sure that you have the VPN switched on, or you will need to be connected to the university network (Eduroam). To set up the VPN, follow ISS instructions here or connecting to Eduroam here.\nWhen you are connected, navigate to https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk, where you will be shown a login screen that looks like the below. Click the option that says “Sign in with SAML”.\n\nThis will take you through to the University login screen, where you should enter your username (e.g. ivorym) and then your university password. This will then redirect you to the R server where you can start using RStudio!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have already logged in through the university login, then you may not see the username/password screen. When you click login, you will be redirected straight to RStudio. This is because the server shares the login information securely across the university.\n\n\n\nWhat does RStudio look like?\nWhen RStudio starts, it will look something like this: \nRStudio has three panels or windows: there are tabs for Console (taking up the left hand side), Environment (and History top right), Current file (bottom right). You will also see a 4th window for a script or set of commands you develop, also (on the left hand side).\n\n\n\nTask Two: using the console\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nText that is highlighted with a grey background denotes code, rather than typical prose. Code is different to other forms of writing, such as essays, because the syntax, order and words need to be quite specific. For some longer chunks of code, as you will see below, they are formatted slightly differently.\n\n\n\nIn the “console” part of the R window, next to the &gt;, type 10 + 30. Press return.\n\n\n10 + 30                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you hover your mouse over the box that includes the code snippet, a ‘copy to clipboard’ icon will appear in the top right corner of the box. Click that to copy the code. Now you can easily paste it into your script.\n\n\nIt should give you the answer 40.\n\nIn the console, type a &lt;- 40 and press Return.\n\n\na &lt;- 40                      \n\n\nNow type a and press return.

K., Gao, C., & Fillmore, P. (2021). Bedtime music, involuntary musical imagery, and sleep. Psychological Science, 32(7), 985-997. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797621989724\nAbstract Many people listen to music for hours every day, often near bedtime. We investigated whether music listening affects sleep, focusing on a rarely explored mechanism: involuntary musical imagery (earworms). In Study 1 (N = 199, mean age = 35.9 years), individuals who frequently listen to music reported persistent nighttime earworms, which were associated with worse sleep quality. In Study 2 (N = 50, mean age = 21.2 years), we randomly assigned each participant to listen to lyrical or instrumental-only versions of popular songs before bed in a laboratory, discovering that instrumental music increased the incidence of nighttime earworms and worsened polysomnography-measured sleep quality. In both studies, earworms were experienced during awakenings, suggesting that the sleeping brain continues to process musical melodies. Study 3 substantiated this possibility by showing a significant increase in frontal slow oscillation activity, a marker of sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Thus, some types of music can disrupt nighttime sleep by inducing long-lasting earworms that are perpetuated by spontaneous memory-reactivation processes.\nThe data from the study is available on this osf website. The data we will look at is from the first study, the data set called “Earworm_MTurk_OSF.sav” on the osf site. These data are saved in spss format, which is not great for R-studio. We can still read it in, though, using a function called spss.get()\n\nBrowse the paper to see what it is about. Focus on Study 1.\nFrom the osf website download the data file: Earworm_MTurk_OSF.sav, and also download the codebook file: Earworm_MTurk_Codebook.xlsx. The codebook tells you what each of the measures are in the data file.\nLoad the data into R-studio: in the bottom right panel of R-studio, click on Upload, and browse to the Earworm_MTurk_OSF.sav file. It should then appear in the list of files in that bottom right panel.\nThat step means we can access the data, but it isn’t yet loaded into R-studio.\n\nSo, next load the data file into R-studio so we can work on it. You might have noticed that the data file is in SPSS format (that’s what the .sav ending to the file means). But, we can still load that in to R-studio.\nTo do that first, load the library Hmisc: library(Hmisc)\n\nlibrary(Hmisc)\n\n\nThen, use the function spss.get():\n\n\ndat &lt;- spss.get(\"Earworm_MTurk_OSF.sav\")\n\n\nThat should have made you a new object in R-studio called “dat” which contains the data from the study.\nNext, we can have a look at the data. Here are a few questions to get you going:\n\n\nHow many male, how many female participants?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n112 male, 87 female\n\nlibrary(Hmisc)\ndat &lt;- spss.get(\"data/PSYC411_wk1/EArworm_MTurk_OSF.sav\")\n# note that my use of the spss.get function here looks in the folder data and the subfolder PSYC411_wk1 because that's where I've put my EArworm_MTurk_OSF.sav data file.\nsummary(dat$Gender)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many people never have earworms in the middle of the night?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n97\n\nsummary(dat$Earworms.MiddleOfTheNight)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, how many participants felt “Somewhat foggy, let down”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\nsummary(dat$StanfordSleepinessScale)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the mean, SD and range of age of the participants? Does your calculation of mean age correspond to that given in the paper?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nmean = 35.9, sd = 10.9, range 20-73.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nsummarise(dat, mean(Age), sd(Age), min(Age), max(Age))\n# summarise does lots of things at the same time, you could also just do them one by one:\nmean(dat$Age); sd(dat$Age); min(dat$Age); max(dat$Age)\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you work out the mean age of the male and female participants separately?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat %&gt;% group_by(Gender) %&gt;% summarise(mean(Age))\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data, see if you can remember tasks for separating different subgroups, graphing relations, comparing groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# this is just one example, other commands and ways are also legitimate:\ndat %&gt;% ggplot( aes(x = PSQI.TST, y = PSQI.SOL)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Data\n(There are no data that you need for today’s practical, other than the link to the data for the earworm study, but when there are data sets you need, you will find them in this data section.)\n\n\n1.4.3 Answers\nThe answers to the workbook have now appeared below each question in the workbook, above, after the practical has finished, so you can check your answers.\nIt’s really important for your learning that you have a go first of all at the workbook before looking at the answers.",

    "text": "Working with data associated with a published analysis\nIn the following, I split our guidance into two parts.\n\nI look next at the task of locating, accessing and checking the data.\nThen I look at the task of how you can Plan the analysis you want to do.\n\nObviously, you cannot consider an analysis if you cannot be sure that you can work with the data (Minocher et al., n.d.).\n\nLocate, access and check the data\nAt the start of your work on the assignment, you will need to (1.) locate then (2.) access data for analysis, and then you will need to (3.) check that the data are usable. I set out advice on doing each step, following. Work through the steps: one step at a time.\n\nLocate\nIt is usually helpful to find a data-set where the data have been collected in a study within a topic area you care about, or could be interested in. It is helpful because you will need to work with the data and it will be motivating if you are interested in what the data concern. And it is helpful because, often, you will need to do a bit of reading on related research to learn about the context for the data collection, and you will usually want to read research sources that interest you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe task here is:\n\nDo a search: look for an article with usable data in a topic area that interests you.\n\n\n\nThere are at least two ways you can do this. Both should be reasonably quick methods to get to a usable data-set.\n\nDo a search on Google scholar).\nDo a search on the webpages of a journal.\n\nMost psychological research is published in journals like Psychological Science. If you want, you can look at a list of psychology journals here.\nIn a journal like Psychological Science you can look through lists of previously published articles (in issues, volumes, by year) on the journal webpage. Here is the list of issues for Psychological Science..\n\nKey words\nIn both methods, you are looking for an article associated with data (and maybe analysis code) you can access and that you are sure you can use. In both methods, you need to first think about some key words to use in your search. Ask yourself:\n\nWhat are you interested in? What population, intervention or effect, comparison, or outcome?\n\nThen:\n\nWhat words do people use, in articles you have seen, when they talk about this thing?\n\nYou can use these words, and maybe consider alternate terms. For example, I am interested in reading comprehension or development reading comprehension but researchers working on reading development might also refer to children reading comprehension.\nYou want to be as efficient as possible so combine your search for articles in an interesting topic area with your search for accessible data. We can learn, here, from the evidence on researcher practice, discussed in the Why chapter section Data and code sharing: we can look for specific markers that data associated with an article should be accessible.\nIf you are doing a search (1.) on Google scholar), I would use the key words related to your topic plus words like: open data badge; open science badge. So, for example, I would do a search for the words: reading comprehension open data badge. I have done this: you can try it. The search results will list articles related to the topic of reading comprehension, where the authors claim to have earned the open data badge because they have made data available.\nIf you are doing a search (2.) in a journal list of articles, then what you are looking for are articles that interest you and which are listed with open data badges. In the listing for Psychological Science (here)) a quick read of the journal issue articles index shows that article titles are listed together with symbols representing the open science badges that authors have claimed.\nIn other journals (e.g., PLOS ONE, PeerJ, Collabra), you may be looking for interesting articles with the words Data Availability Statement, Data Accessibility Statement, Supplementary data or Supplementary materials in the article webpage somewhere. Journals like PeerJ or Collabra, in particular, make it easy to locate data associated with published articles on their web pages.\nIn Collabra, you can find published articles through the journal webpage (here). If you click on the title of any article, and look at the article webpage, then on the left of the article text, you can see an index of article contents and that index lists the Data Availability Statement. Click on that and you are often taken to a link to a data repository.\n\n\n\nAccess\nIf you have located an interesting article with evidence (an open data badge or a data accessibility statement) that the authors have shared their data, you need to check that you can access the data. Most of the time, now, you are looking for a link you can use to go directly to the shared data. The link is often presented as a hyperlink on a webpage, associated with Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) or Universal resource locators (URLs). Or, increasingly, you are looking for a link to a data repository on a site like the Open Science Framework (OSF).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe task here is:\n\nAccess the data associated with the article you have found.\n\n\n\nHere are some recent examples from my work that you can check, to give you a sense of where or how to find the accessible link to the shared data.\n\nRicketts, J., Dawson, N., & Davies, R. (2021). The hidden depths of new word knowledge: Using graded measures of orthographic and semantic learning to measure vocabulary acquisition. Learning and Instruction, 74, 101468. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2021.101468\n\n\nRodríguez-Ferreiro, J., Aguilera, M., & Davies, R. (2020). Semantic priming and schizotypal personality: Reassessing the link between thought disorder and enhanced spreading of semantic activation. PeerJ, 8, e9511. https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9511\n\nThese are both open access articles.\nIf you look at the webpage for Rodríguez-Ferreiro et al. (2020), (here)), you can do a search in the article text for the keyword OSF (on the article webpage, use keys CMD-F plus OSF). You are checking to see if you can click on the link and and if clicking on the link takes you to a repository listing the data for the article. The Rodríguez-Ferreiro et al. (2020) article is associated with a data plus analysis code repository (OSF))\nNotice that on the repository webpage, you can see a description of the project plus .pdf files and a folder data-set and Code. If you can click through to the folders, and download the datafiles, you have accessed the data successfully.\nI have guided you, here, through to the Rodríguez-Ferreiro et al. (2020) data repository, can you find the data for the Ricketts et al. (2021) repository?\n\n\nCheck\nIf you have located an interesting article with data that you can access, and if you have read the Why chapter discussion on Enabling others to check or query analyses, then you will be ready, next, to check that you can use the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe task here is:\n\nCheck the data and the data documentation to make sure you can understand what you have got and whether you can use it.\n\n\n\nWhat make data usable are:\n\nInformation in the article, or in the data repository documentation, on the study design and data collection methods: you need to be able to understand where the data came from, how they were collected, and why.\nClear data documentation: you need to find information on the variables, the observations, the scoring, the coding, and whether and how the data were processed to get them from raw data state to the data ready for analysis.\n\nData documentation is often presented as a note or a wiki page or a miniature paper and may be called a codebook, data dictionary, guide to materials or something similar. You will need to check that you can find information on (examples shown are from the Rodríguez-Ferreiro et al. (2020) OSF guide to materials):\n\nwhat the data files are called, e.g., PrimDir-111019.csv;\nhow the named data files correspond to the studies presented in the report;\nwhat the data file columns are called and what variables the column data represent, e.g., relation, coding for prime-target relatedness condition ...;\nhow scores or responses in columns were collected or calculated, e.g., age, giving the age in years ...;\nhow coding was done, if coding was used, e.g., biling, giving the bilingualism status;\nwhether data were processed, how missing values were coded, whether participants or observations were excluded before analysis, e.g., Missing values in the rt column ... coded as NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf these information are not presented, or are not clear: walk away.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan the analysis you want to do\nAfter you have found an interesting article, and have confirmed that you can use the associated data, you will need to plan what analysis you want to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe task here is:\n\nIdentify and understand the analysis in the article.\nWork out what analysis you want to do.\n\n\n\nStudents have taken a variety of approaches to the assignment.\n\nSome students choose to complete a reanalysis of the data, in an attempt to reproduce the results presented in the article: you can learn about this in the Why chapter discussion on Methods reproducibility, and you can use the advice in the next section on Completing a reanalysis of the data.\nSome students choose to complete an alternate analysis of the data, varying elements of the analysis: you can learn about this in the Why chapter discussion on Multiverse analyses, and you can use the advice in the following section on Completing an alternate analysis of the data.\n\nEither way, you will want to first make sure you can identify exactly what the authors of the original study did, how they did it, and why they did it.\nYou can process the key article information efficiently using the QALMRI method we discussed in the PSYC413 class on graduate writing skills (Brosowsky et al., n.d.; Kosslyn & Rosenberg, 2005), summarised in the slides from that class. You are first aiming to locate information on the broad and the specific question the study addresses, the methods the study authors used to collect data, the results they report, and the conclusions they present given the results.\nCan you find these bits of information?\n\nCompleting a reanalysis of the data\nAre you interested in attempting a methods reproducibility test?\nFollowing Hardwicke and colleagues (Hardwicke et al., n.d.; Hardwicke et al., 2018), it would be sensible to focus on identifying the primary or substantive result for a study in an article.\n\nThe result is substantive if the researchers state that it is (e.g., “Our critical analysis is…”), if it is emphasized in the abstract, or if it is presented in a table or figure.\n\nAs we discussed in the class on graduate writing skills, the article authors should signal what they consider to be the primary result for a study by telling you that a result is critical or key or that a result is the or an answer to their research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nAn article may present multiple studies: focus on one.\nThe results section of an article, for a study, may list multiple results: identify the primary or substantive result.\n\n\n\nYou will want to identify a result that is both substantive and straightforward (Hardwicke et al., n.d.; Hardwicke et al., 2018).\n\nThe result is Straightforward if the outcome could be calculated using the kind of test you have been learning about or will learn about (e.g., t-test, correlation, the linear model)\n\nPsychological science researchers use a variety of data analysis methods and not all the analyses that you read about will be analyses done using methods that you know about. The use of the methods we teach — t-test, correlation, and the linear model — are very very common; that is why we teach them. But you may also see reports of analyses done using methods like ANOVA, and multilevel or (increasingly) linear mixed-effects models (Meteyard & Davies, 2020).\nIn research on the reproducibility of results in the literature (see the Why chapter section on Enabling others to check or query analyses), the researchers attempting to reproduce results often focused on answering the research question the original authors stated using the data the original authors shared. This does not mean that they always tried to exactly reproduce an analysis or an analysis result. Sometimes, that was not possible.\nSometimes, you will encounter an article and a data-set you are interested in but the analysis presented in the article looks a bit complicated, or more complex than the methods you have learned would allow you to do. In this situation, don’t give up.\nWhat you can do – maybe with our advice – is identify a part of the primary result that you can try to reproduce. For example, what if the original study authors report a linear mixed-effects analysis of the effects of both prime relatedness and schizotypy score on response reaction time (Rodríguez-Ferreiro et al., 2020)? Maybe you have not learned about mixed-effects models, or you have not learned about analysing the effects of two variables but you have (you will) learn about analysing the effect of one variable using the linear model method: OK then, do an analysis of the shared data using the method you know.\nYou may be helped, here, by knowing about two good-enough (mostly true) insights from statistical analysis:\n\nMany of the common analysis methods you see used in psychological science can be coded as a linear model.\nMore advanced common analysis methods — (Generalized) Linear Mixed-effects Models (GLMMs) — can be understood as more sophisticated versions of the linear model. (Conversely, the linear model can be understood as an approximation of a GLMM.)\n\nThere is a nice discussion of the idea that common statistical tests are linear models here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the analysis method used to get the result you are interested in.\nIf it is complex or unfamiliar, discuss whether a simpler method can be used.\nIf the result is complex, discuss whether you can attempt to reproduce a part or a simpler result.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleting an alternate analysis of the data\nAre you interested in attempting a different analysis than the analysis you see in the journal article?\nIt can be interesting and important work to complete a simpler analysis of shared data. Sometimes, we learn that a simpler analysis provides a good account of the behaviour we observe, perhaps as good an account as that produced using other, more complex, analyses. This can happen if, for example, our theory predicts that two effects should work together but an analysis shows that we can explain behaviour in an account in which the two effects are independent. For example, Ricketts et al. (2021) predicted that children should learn words more effectively if they were shown the spellings of the words and if they were told they would be helped by seeing the spelling but, in our data, we found that just seeing the spellings was enough to explain the learning we observed.\nIn completing analyses that vary from original analyses, we are engaging in the kind of work people do when they do multiverse analyses, also known as sensitivity checks or robustness checks (see the Why chapter section on the Analysis multiverse).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn planning an alternate or multiverse analysis, do not suppose that you need to do multiple analyses: you do not.\n\n\nIn planning an alternate or multiverse analysis, you will want to begin by critically evaluating the analysis you see described in the published article. I talk about how to do this, next.\nBefore we go on, note that I previously discussed an example of how to critically evaluate the results of published research in the context of Rodríguez-Ferreiro et al. (2020). Take a look at the Introduction of that article. There, we summarised the analyses researchers did previously and used the information about the analyses to explain inconsistencies in the research literature. We found limitations in the analyses that people did that had (negative) consequences for the strength of the conclusions we can take from the data.\n\nCritically evaluate the analysis description\nIf you revisit our discussion of multiverse analyses, you will see that we discussed two things:\n\nanalyses of the impact on results of varying how you construct data-sets before analysis — see the Why chapter section on The data multiverse;\nanalyses of the impact on results of varying what analysis method you use, or how you use the method — see the Why chapter section on Analysis multiverses.\n\nLearning about (1.) the ways in which data-set construction can vary, and (2.) the ways in which analysis choices can vary are both good preparation for approaching the task of critically evaluating any description of the analysis you see in any published article.\nAs we noted in the Why chapter section on multiverse data, you almost always have to process the data you collect (in an experiment or a survey) before you can analyse the data. Often, this means you need to code for responses to survey questions, e.g., asking people to self-report their gender, or you need to identify and code for people making errors when they try to do the experimental task you set them, or you need to process the data to exclude participants who took too long to do the task (if taking too long is a problem). Not all of these processing steps will have an impact on the results but some might. This is why you can sometimes do useful and sometimes original research work in reanalysing previously published data.\nYou can begin your analysis planning work by first identifying exactly what data processing the original study authors did then identifying what different data processing they could have done. Remember the research we discussed in relation to reproducibility studies: you need to be prepared for the possibility that it is sometimes challenging to identify what researchers did to process their data for analysis (see more information in. To identify the information you need, look for keywords like code, exclude, process, tidy, transform in the text of the article, or look for words like this in the documentation you find in the data repository.\nWhen you have identified this information, you can then consider three questions:\n\nWhat data processing steps were completed before analysis?\nWhat were the reasons given explaining why these processing steps were completed?\nWhat could happen to the results if different choices were made?\n\nWorking through these questions can then get you to a good plan for an analysis of the data. For example, a simple but useful analysis you can do is to check what happens to the results if you do an analysis with data from all the participants tested, if participants were originally excluded (for some reason) in the data processing step. Obviously, if the original study authors only share processed data (after exclusions), you cannot do this kind of work. Another simple but useful analysis you can do is to check what happens to the results if you change the coding of variables. Sometimes different coding of categorical variables (e.g., ethnicity) are reasonable. For example, you can ask: what happens if you analyse the impact of the variable given a different coding? (In case you are reading these notes and thinking about recoding a factor, there are some useful functions you can use; read about them here.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to check the impact of varying data processing choices: check, do you need and have access to the raw data? can you see how to recode variables?\n\n\n\nAs we noted in the Why chapter section on multiverse analyses, when we consider how to answer a research question with a data-set, it is often possible to imagine multiple different analysis methods: potentially, all reasonable alternatives. Most often, this is most clearly apparent when we are looking at an observational data-set or data collected given a cross-sectional study design.\nIn cross-sectional or observational studies, we typically are not manipulating experimental conditions, and we are often analysed data using some kind of linear model. We often collect data or have access to data on a number of different variables relevant to our interests. For example, in studies I have done on how people read (R. Davies et al., 2013; R. A. I. Davies et al., 2017), we wanted to know what factors would predict or influence how people do basic reading tasks like reading aloud. We collected information on many different kinds of word properties and on the attributes of the participants we tested. (Note: the papers are associated with data repositories in Supplementary Materials.) It is often an open question which variables should be included in a prediction model of the observed outcome (reading response reaction times). Therefore, if you are interested in a study like this, and can access usable data from the study, it will typically be true that you are able to sensibly motivate a different analysis of the study data using a different choice of variables.\nAs discussed in a number of interesting analyses over the years (e.g., Patel et al., 2015), researchers may be interested in the specific impact of one particular predictor variable (e.g., we may be interested in whether it is easier to read words we learned early in life), but will need to include in their analysis that variable plus other variables known to affect the outcome. In that situation, the effect of the variable of interest may appear to be different depending on what other variables are also analysed. This makes it interesting and useful to check the impact of different analysis choices.\nWe will look at data like these, for analyses involving the linear model, in our classes on this method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nDo you want to check the impact of different analysis choices: check, do you need and have access to a choice of variables?\nCan you think of some reasons to justify using a different choice of variables in your analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary: working with data associated with a published analysis\nHere’s a quick summary of the advice we have discussed so far.\n\nAt the start of your work, you will need to (1.) locate then (2.) access data for analysis, and then you will need to (3.) check that the data are usable.\nOnce you have confirmed you have found interesting data you can use, you should plan your analysis.\nStudents do a variety of kinds of analysis. Whatever your interest, you first will want to first make sure you can identify exactly what the authors of the original study did, how they did it, and why they did it.\nIf you are interested in completing a reanalysis, attempting a methods reproducibility test (can you repeat a result, given shared data?) you will perhaps benefit from focusing on a result that is both substantive and straightforward.\nIf you are interested in doing an alternate or multiverse analysis, you can critically evaluate the data processing and the data analysis choices that the original study authors made. You can consider whether other choices would be appropriate, and might sensibly motivate a (limited) investigation of the impact of different analysis choices on the results.\n\nWhat if you access interesting data that were shared but that are not associated with a published analysis? We talk about that situation, next.",

    "text": "Working with data that are not associated with a published analysis\nA number of data-sets have been published online with information about the data but with no analysis. You can look for data that may be interest you in a number of different places, now, but I would focus on one. I talk about that next. Then I offer some guidance on Thinking about analyses of open data.\n\nLooking for open data\nWicherts and colleagues set up the Journal of Open Psychology Data (JOPD) to make it easier for Psychologists to share experimental data. A link to the journal webpage is here) Usually, a data paper reports a study and provides a link to a downloadable data-set.\nSome data-sets that I have looked at in JOPD and other places include those described following.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI identify these examples because they present interesting, rich, and readily accessible data-sets that could be used in a variety of different kinds of analyses.\n\n\n\nWicherts intelligence and personality data\nWicherts did what he recommended and put a large data-set online here\nYou can analyse these data in a number of different interesting ways. You can explore relationships between gender, intelligence and personality differences.\nThe data file and an explanatory document are located at the end of the article. Read the article, it’s worth your time.\nWicherts reports:\n\nThe file includes data from our freshman-testing program called “Testweek” (Busato et al., 2000, Smits et al., 2011 and Wicherts and Vorst, 2010) in which 537 students (age: M = 21.0, SD = 4.3) took the Advanced Progressive Matrices ( Raven, Court, & Raven, 1996), a test of Arithmetic, a Number Series test, a Hidden Figures Test, a test of Vocabulary, a test of Verbal Analogies, and a Logical Reasoning test (Elshout, 1976).\nAlso included are data from a Dutch big five personality inventory (Elshout & Akkerman, 1975), the NEO-PI-R (Hoekstra, Ormel, & Fruyt, 1996), scales of social desirability and impression management (based on work by Paulhus, 1984 and Wicherts, 2002), sex of the participants, and grade point averages of the freshmen’s first trimester that may act as outcome variable.\n\n\n\nSmits personality data\nSmits and colleagues (including Wicherts) put an even larger data-set online at the Journal of Open Psychology Data here)\nYou will need to register to be able to download the data but the process is simple.\nThe Smits data-set includes Big-5 personality scores for several thousand individuals recorded over a series of years. You can analyse these data in interesting ways including examining changes in personality scores among students over different years.\n\n\nEmbodied terror management\nTjew A Sin and colleagues shared a data-set at the Journal of Open Psychology Data on an interesting study they did to test the idea that interpersonal touch or simulated interpersonal touch can relieve existential concerns (fear of death) among individuals with low self-esteem. The data can be found here)\nThe Tjew A Sin can be downloaded from a link to a repository location, given at the end of the article. You will likely need to register to download the data. Note that the spreadsheets holding the study data include 999 values to code for missing data. Note also that the data spreadsheets include (in different columns) scores per participant for various measures e.g. mortality anxiety or self-esteem. The measures are explained in the paper. To use the data, you will need to work out the simple process of how to sum the scores across items to get e.g. a measure of self-esteem for each person.\n\n\nDemographic influences on disgust\nBerger and Anaki shared data on the disgust sensitivity of a large sample of individuals. The data are from the administration of the Disgust Scale to a set of Hebrew speakers. They can be found here)\nThe experimenters collected data on participants’ characteristics so that analyses of the way in which sensitivity varies in relation to demographic attributes is possible. You will see that the disgust scale is explained in the paper. The different disgust scores, for each item in the disgust scale, can be found in different columns. The disgust scores, for person, are calculated overall as values: Mean_general_ds, Mean_core, Mean_Animal_reminder, Mean_Contamination\nWhen you download the data-set, you may need to change the file name — adding a suffix: .txt (for the tab delimited file), to be opened in Excel, or .sav (for the SPSS data file), to be opened in SPSS — to the file name to allow you to open it in the appropriate application.\n\n\n\nThinking about analyses of open data\nThe availability of rich, curated, clearly usable data-sets with many variables can make it challenging to decide what to do.\nI would advise beginning with an exploratory analysis of the data you have accessed. You will want to begin by using the data visualization skills we have taught you to examine:\n\nThe distributions of the variables that interest you using histograms, density plots or bar charts.\nThe potential relationship between variables using scatterplots.\n\nIn such Exploratory Data analyses, you are interested in what the data visualization tells you about the nature of the data-set you have accessed. The papers associated with the data-sets can sometimes offer only outline information: how the data were collected, coded, and processed. You may need to satisfy yourself that there is nothing odd or surprising about the distributions of scores. This stage can help you to identify problems like survey responses with implausible scores.\nThe work you do in exploring, and summarizing, the data variables that interest you will often constitute a substantial element of the work you can do and present for your report. You may discuss, for advice, what parts of this work will be interesting or useful to present.\nThen, our advice is simple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nWhen working with open data-sets, consider keeping the analysis simple.\n\n\n\nNote that simple is relative. Do what interests you. Work with the methods you have learned or will learn (the linear model).\nIn practice, you will find that part of the challenge is located not in using the data or in running an analysis like a linear model, it is in (1.) justifying or motivating the analysis and (2.) explaining the implications of your findings.\nWorking on the thinking you must develop to motivate an analysis or to explain implications requires you to do some (limited) reading of relevant research. (Relevant sources will be cited in data papers, as part of their outline of the background for their data collection.) If you consider the advice we discussed in the graduate class on developing writing skills, you will see that there I talked about how you might extract data from a set of relevant sources (papers) to get an understanding of the questions people ask, the assumptions they make. That is the kind of process you can follow to develop your thinking around the analysis you will do. What you are looking for is information you can use so that you can say something brief about, for example, why it might be interesting to analyse, say, whether personality (measured using the Big-5) varies given differences in gender or differences between population cohorts. The reading and the conceptual development should be fairly limited, not extensive, but should be sufficient that you can write something sensible when you introduce and then when you discuss your analysis results.",

    "text": "Summary: how\nIn this chapter, I have outlined some advice on how you might approach the task of locating, accessing, and analyzing previously collected data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe main advice is to think about your workflow in stages, then progress through the work one step at a time.\n\n\nYou will need to begin by assuring yourself that you can find a data-set that interests you, and that you can access and use the data. The usability of data will require clear, understandable, descriptions in the published article (if any) about the research question and hypothesis, the study design, the data collection methods, the data processing steps, and the data analysis (if any). Sometimes, useful information about data processing and data analysis can be found in detail in repository documentation (e.g., in guides to materials) but only referenced in the text of the article.\nIf you know you can locate, access and have checked data as usable, you will want to think about what analysis you want to do the data. The approach you take depending on what aims you would like to pursue.\nIf you are interested in attempting a methods reproducibility test (i.e., checking if you can repeat presented results, given shared data), then you will first need to identify a substantive and straightforward result to try to reproduce. If you identify a primary result to examine, you will want to check that you can work with the data that have been shared, and then that you can use the analysis methods you have learned to reproduce some or all of the result that interests you.\nIf you are interested in doing an alternate or a different analysis (from what may be presented), you may need to consider the information you can locate on data processing and on data analysis choices. Did the original study authors process the data before sharing it, how? are the raw data available? What analyses did the authors do and why? When you consider this information, you may critically evaluate the choices made. In the context of this critical evaluation, you may find good reasons to justify doing a different analysis, whether to examine the impact of making different data processing choices, or to examine the impact of using a different analysis method, or of applying the same method differently (e.g., by including different variables).\nIn considering an analysis of data shared without a published set of results, you may want to keep your approach simple. Focus on what analysis you can do using the methods you have learned. And think about the understanding you will need to develop, to justify the analysis you do, and to make sense, in the discussion of your report of the analysis results you will present.\nIt is always a good idea to explore your data using visualization techniques throughout your workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nYou can always get advice, do not hesitate to ask.\nWe are happy to discuss your thinking, especially in class.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBrosowsky, N., Parshina, O., Locicero, A., & Crump, M.

After you have done this, what information does summary() give you about the variable study?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.4. We can see the number 169 beside the word studyone: this tells us that there are 169 observations, in the column, each one is a value: the word or character string studyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember from Week 3 that we can only count how many times a category value (or factor level) occurs: here, we are counting how many times the word studyone occurs in the factor column study.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.2.3 How-to Part 3: Visualize associations\n\nHow-to Task 6 – Draw scatterplots to examine associations between variables\nYou have seen these code moves before, in previous classes (weeks 3 and 4): we are consolidating skills by practising your coding in different contexts, using different data.\nWe extend your skills by adding some new moves.\nCreate scatterplots to examine the association between some variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe are working with geom_point() and you need x and y aesthetic mappings.\n\n\nFor example, we can draw a scatterplot to examine the association between mean.self and mean.acc.\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = mean.self, y = mean.acc)) + \n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine this plot — it shows: the possible association between x-axis variable mean.self and y-axis variable mean.acc.\nYou have seen this kind of code before but it will help your learning if, now, we take a look at the code step-by-step.\nThe plot code moves through the following steps:\n\nggplot(...) makes a plot.\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, ...) uses the study.one.gen data-set.\nggplot(...aes(x = mean.self, y = mean.acc)) uses two aesthetic mappings.\ngeom_point() show the mappings as points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhat are aesthetic mappings?\nAesthetic mappings translate data information – numbers or values in column variables – into things you can see in plots.\nFor a scatterplot, we need to translate values for two variables into the position of each point in the plot.\nHere:\n\nx = mean.self maps mean.self values to x-axis (horizontal, left to right) positions.\ny = mean.acc maps mean.acc values to y-axis (vertical, bottom to top) positions.\n\n\n\nNow do scatterplots with any pair of numeric variables you like.\nRemember that we saw with summary() that not every variable consists of numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the example code.\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(y = mean.self, x = mean.acc)) +\n    geom_point()  \n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = AGE, y = mean.self)) +\n  geom_point()  \n  \nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = SHIPLEY, y = mean.self)) +\n  geom_point()  \n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = HLVA, y = mean.self)) +\n  geom_point()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow-to Task 7 – Edit the scatterplots to change how they look\nEdit the appearance of a plot step-by-step.\nWe are going to edit:\n\nthe appearance of the points using alpha and size;\nthe colour of the background using theme_bw();\nthe appearance of the labels using labs().\n\nWe make the changes, one change at a time.\nYou have seen one of these moves before and you can guess at how to do the others. Click on the drop-down view to see the code but, if you want a challenge, try first to write the code on your own.\n\nthe appearance of the points using alpha and size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = HLVA, y = mean.self)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe colour of the background using theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = HLVA, y = mean.self)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2)  +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe appearance of the labels using labs()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = HLVA, y = mean.self)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2)  +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"HLVA\", y = \"mean self rated accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe arguments alpha and size can change the appearance of most geometric objects (geoms) in ggplot:\n\nin the code example, here, we vary the alpha number to change how opaque or transparent the points are;\nand we vary the size number to vary the size of the points.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow-to Task 8 – Now experiment\nThere are no right answers here: edit the appearance of your plots by changing alpha, size and colour of points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPlay is an important part of learning.\n\nExperimenting with how plots look is a key element in becoming a master at data visualization. You won’t know what looks good to you unless you try different things.\n\n\n\nIf you really want to extend your skills, it is really important that you learn how to find useful online help.\n\nQ.5. Can you find the ggplot reference page on scatterplots?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a search with the keywords: ggplot reference geom_point\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.5. You can find reference information here: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.6. Can you change the colour of the points to a colour you like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a search with the keywords: ggplot colours.\nUseful information on colour can be found here:\nhttps://r-graphics.org/recipe-colors-setting\nor\nhttp://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.6. Here is how you do it: R will recognize many English colour names.\n\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = HLVA, y = mean.self)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2, colour = \"hotpink\")  +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"HLVA\", y = \"mean self rated accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNow you: experiment!\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.2.4 How-to Part 4: Analyse associations\n\nHow-to Task 9 – Use correlation to to answer a research question\nExamine associations between variables using correlation.\nOne of our research questions is:\n\nCan people accurately evaluate whether they correctly understand written health information?\n\nWe can answer this question by examining whether mean self-rated accuracy of understanding correlates with mean accuracy of understanding. The logic is that if we can accurately rate our own understanding (from bad to good) then that rating should be associated – should be correlated with – how accurately we can actually respond to questions that test that understanding.\n\nQ.7. How do we examine the correlation between mean self-rated accuracy (mean.self) and mean accuracy (mean.acc)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember from the Week 6 lecture, that we use cor.test():\n\n\n\nCan you figure out how to code a correlation test? It helps with your learning if you first try to anticipate what the code will look like. Then reveal the code, below, to see what you guessed right. (Getting some things right, and some things wrong, is part of the learning process.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.7. Here is how you do it: take a look at the code and the results of the correlation test.\n\n\ncor.test(study.one.gen$mean.acc, study.one.gen$mean.self, method = \"pearson\",  alternative = \"two.sided\")\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  study.one.gen$mean.acc and study.one.gen$mean.self\nt = 7.1936, df = 167, p-value = 2.026e-11\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.3619961 0.5937425\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.4863771 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.8.

To do this, we will learn to think about and work with linear models.\nLooking ahead to your professional lives, learning about linear models will equip you to do behavioural analysis in a wide range of contexts, from clinical research to business intelligence.\nAs students, now, learning about linear model analyses in the context of the Clearly understood project will help you to understand how to critically evaluate research when you read about it (or write about it) in research reports.\nYou will see that the linear model is very flexible and powerful so learning to use it effectively involves not only learning to code analyses but also learning to think critically about what it is you want to do with it.",

To do this, we will learn to think about and work with linear models.\nLooking ahead to your professional lives, learning about linear models will equip you to do behavioural analysis in a wide range of contexts, from clinical research to business intelligence.\nAs students, now, learning about linear model analyses in the context of the Clearly understood project will help you to understand how to critically evaluate research when you read about it (or write about it) in research reports.\nYou will see that the linear model is very flexible and powerful so learning to use it effectively involves not only learning to code analyses but also learning to think critically about what it is you want to do with it.",

(ii.) does the association reflect a positive or negative relationship between outcome and predictor?

have seen how to produce histograms before, in a previous class (week 3): here we are consolidating skills by practising them in different contexts, using different data.\nWe extend your skills by adding some new moves.\nWhen we learn about creating a plot, it helps us to identify what each code element is doing. Here’s an example: run the line of code and see the result in the Plots window in R-Studio:\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = mean.acc)) + geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the plotting code elements and what they are doing:\n\nggplot(...) you tell R you want to make a plot using the ggplot() function;\nggplot(data = study.one.gen ...) you tell R you want to make a plot with the study.one.gen data;\nggplot(..., aes(x = mean.acc)) you tell R that you want to make a plot with the variable mean.acc;\nhere, you specify the aesthetic mapping, x = mean.acc;\nggplot(...) + geom_histogram() you tell R you want to show the distribution of values of mean.acc as a geometric object: a histogram.\n\nYou have seen the plotting code arranged in two different ways, in one line, as above, or in a series of steps, like this:\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = mean.acc)) + \n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that it has no impact whether you write the plotting code in one line, or in a series of lines.\n\nR cares very much about how you spell function or variable names.\nR does not usually care about line breaks.\n\nLearning what does or does not matter is a key lesson, when you learn a language, whatever the language.\n\n\nIf we break the plotting code into steps, it makes the code easier for you to read, and it will make it easier to add edits, one at a time. Let’s see how that works, next.\nTo help you learn, we are going to work on editing the code to do things, and we are going to explain why we want to be able to do these things.\nThese are the things we want to do:\n\nnew – the appearance of the bars using binwidth;\nrevision – the colour of the background using theme_bw();\nrevision – the appearance of the labels using labs();\nnew – setting the x-axis limits to reflect the full range of possible scores on the x-axis variable using xlim();\nnew – adding annotation – here, a vertical line using geom_vline() – to focus the attention of the audience for a plot on specific information about the variable distribution (here, the sample average for the variable).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nClick on each Code tab to see how the code changes, and to see how the plot changes as a result.\nClick on each Why tab for an explanation of why we want to do this.\n\nYou may need to hover your cursor over the space to the right of the Code tab to see the Why tab.\n\n\n\nnew – the appearance of the bars using binwidth\n\n\nCodeWhy\n\n\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = SHIPLEY)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram binwidth has to be a number. The best way to learn what the number tells R to do is to experiment with different values.\n\nNotice that in the code we set the binwidth to 2.\nIf you are producing a histogram, binwidth has to be a number larger than the potential minimum and smaller than the potential maximum for the variable you are plotting: so for the SHIPLEY vocabulary test, because the test scores can only range between 0-40, the binwidth number you use in your plotting code has to be bigger than 0 but smaller than 40.\n\nIn general, the larger (wider) the binwidth, the less detail you see about the distribution of values in the variable.\n\nIn a histogram, each bar you draw represents a collection of values. The binwidth tells R how many values to collect together, for each bar. So, the bigger the width, the bigger (wider and taller) the bar because it represents more observations.\n\nWhether or not you want to present detail is then a question concerning your communication aims: do you want to give an impression, or identify a specific detail?\n\n\n\n\nrevision – the colour of the background using theme_bw()\n\n\nCodeWhy\n\n\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = SHIPLEY)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, a grey background is argued to be a good way to present information visually but we often use a white background because it helps the plot elements to be visible, especially, for example, if we are giving a presentation.\n\n\n\n\nrevision – the appearance of the labels using labs()\n\n\nCodeWhy\n\n\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = SHIPLEY)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Vocabulary (SHIPLEY)\", y = \"frequency count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou cannot assume that the audience for your plots will understand what you are referring to, if you just use data-set variable names e.g. SHIPLEY. They may not be familiar with your data-set. This means you need to use axis labels that will make sense to most people in your audience.\n\n\n\n\nnew – setting the x-axis limits using xlim()\n\n\nCodeWhy\n\n\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = SHIPLEY)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Vocabulary (SHIPLEY)\", y = \"frequency count\") +\n  xlim(0,40)\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is often useful to set the axis limits like this: because we want to show the audience where the sample values are distributed compared to where they could be distributed, given the measure.\nThis makes sense, e.g., if you want to see the relative age distribution of a sample compared to the population, or because we want to give the audience a more accurate picture of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nnew – adding annotation – here, a vertical line\n\n\nCodeWhy\n\n\n\nggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = SHIPLEY)) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Vocabulary (SHIPLEY)\", y = \"frequency count\") +\n  xlim(0,40) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(study.one.gen$SHIPLEY), colour = \"red\", linewidth = 1.5)\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we used the geom_vline() element to plot a vertical line at the location on the x-axis we define.\nWe do this in the steps:\n\ngeom_vline(...) – draw a vertical line;\n...xintercept... – draw the line so it hits the x-axis (intercepts the x-axis);\n...xintercept = mean(study.one.gen$SHIPLEY... – at a location defined by the mean of the variable mean(study.one.gen$SHIPLEY);\n...colour = \"red\", size = 1.5.. – make the line red and one and a half times the default thickness.\n\n\n\nWe can use annotations, like this vertical line, when we want to draw the attention of the audience for our plot to a specific feature of the data.\n\n\n\nWhat are we learning here?\nYou can see that while the data stays the same, the appearance of the plot changes, as we add each edit to the plotting code.\nThe lesson that we are learning, here, is not just that you can arrange plotting code in steps but that in general in R you can build things (like plots) one action at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information you can explore\n\n\n\nWe can define the limits on the x-axis and on the y-axis, see the {ggplot2} library reference information on setting limits is here:\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/lims.html\nThe {ggplot2} reference information for drawing lines is here:\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_abline.html\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2.4 How-to Part 4: Developing scatterplots to examine associations between variables\n\nHow-to Task 6 – Edit scatterplot code to visualize associations like a pro\nYou have seen these code moves before, in previous classes (weeks 3 and 4): we are consolidating skills by practising your coding in different contexts, using different data.\nWe extend your skills by adding some new moves.\nWe create scatterplots to examine the association between pairs of variables.

This is because we can expect that if vocabulary knowledge predicts success in understanding then variation in vocabulary knowledge should be associated with variation in success of understanding. We measured how successful study participants were in understanding health information: recording outcome mean.acc as the accuracy of response to questions designed to examine understanding. We measured a key person attribute, vocabulary knowledge using the SHIPLEY vocabulary test. We can then examine the association between this pair of variables using correlation.\nHere, we examine the correlation between the mean accuracy (mean.acc) of understanding of health information, and vocabulary (SHIPLEY) knowledge, for each person in our participant sample.\nCan you figure out how to code the correlation analysis?\nIt helps with your learning if you first try to predict what the code will look like.

In this week’s lab activity we will retrace that analysis focusing on the subset of adjectives (the paper also included verbs and nouns). We’ll use sensory modality ratings as reported by Lynott and Connell (2009; see here for more info; data file: lynott_connell_2009_modality.csv) and word frequencies as reported by the English Lexicon Project (data file: ELP_full_length_frequency.csv). The research question is: Do English speakers use ‘visual’ adjectives more frequently than adjectives more strongly associated with other sensory modalities?\n\nStep 1: Set up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet your working directory\n\n\n\nThe folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class’ contains the data files we’ll need. Make sure you have set your working directory to this folder by right-clicking on it and selecting ‘Set as working directory’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpty the R environment\n\n\n\nBefore you do anything else, when starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one. To do this, you can click on the little broom icon in the top right of the Environment pane, or you can use rm(list=ls()).\n\n\nBefore we can get started we need to tell R which libraries to use. For this analysis we’ll need broom, tidyverse, MASS and pscl.\n\nTASK: Load the relevant libraries. If you are unsure how to do that, you can look at the ‘Hint’ below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(pscl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you couldn’t upload files to the server, do this:\n\n\n\nIf you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the ‘clipboard’ in the top right corner.\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/mg78/2324_PSYC402/blob/main/data/week15/402_week15_forStudents/ELP_full_length_frequency.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"ELP_full_length_frequency.csv\")\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/mg78/2324_PSYC402/blob/main/data/week15/402_week15_forStudents/lynott_connell_2009_modality.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"lynott_connell_2009_modality.csv\")\n\n\nTASK: Finally, read in the two data files (lynott_connell_2009_modality.csv and ELP_full_length_frequency.csv) and have a look at them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the read_csv() function and the head() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nlyn &lt;- read_csv('lynott_connell_2009_modality.csv')\nELP &lt;- read_csv('ELP_full_length_frequency.csv')\nhead(lyn)\nhead(ELP)\n\n\n\nQUESTION 1: Which variables do you need to address the research question?\n\n\nStep 2: A bit of data wrangling\nWe need to combine the information in the data files to be able to do any analyses. We can use a ‘join’ to do this. Have a look at the online book by Hadley Wickam and Gareth Grolemund (here) to remind yourself what a ‘join’ is. In particular, have a look at the inner_join() and the left_join().\nQUESTION 2: Which ‘join’ is most appropriate, the inner_join() or the left_join()? Also, does it matter which data file you specify as x and which one as y? If so, why does it matter?\n\nTASK: Add code to join the two data files and store the resulting table in an object called both. Try out the different joins and use head() to inspect the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should end up with a table that has 423 observations of at least 8 variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nboth &lt;- left_join(x = lyn, y = ELP, by = 'Word')\n\n\n\nNext, we want to select only the variables we need. We want to use the select() function from dplyr. Because the MASS library is also loaded and that library also contains a select() function, we need to tell R specifically to use the one from dplyr. You can do this by using dplyr::, like this:\n\nboth &lt;- both %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(Word, DominantModality:Smell, Log10Freq)\n\n\nTASK: Add the code above to your script and run it.\n\nFinally, to apply Poisson regression, we need the frequency variable as positive integers.\n\nTASK: Use the code below to transform the frequency variable to raw values. Don’t forget to add it to your script and run it.\n\n\nboth &lt;- mutate(both, Freq = 10 ^ Log10Freq)\n\nQUESTION 3: What does this line of code do. Write a comment to summarise its function.\n\n\nStep 3: Visualise the data\nTo get a better feel for the data, let’s make some scatterplots.\n\nTASK: Add code to make scatterplots with Freq on the y axis and each of the sensory modality ratings on the respective x axis. To be able to see more easily what is going on, limit the y-axis to values between 0 and 20000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nMake 5 different scatterplots using ggplot() withgeom_point() and geom_smooth(). You can use ylim() to limit the values on the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(both, aes(x = Sight, y = Freq)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  ylim(c(0, 20000))\n\nggplot(both, aes(x = Touch, y = Freq)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw()  +\n  ylim(c(0, 20000))  \n\nggplot(both, aes(x = Sound, y = Freq)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  ylim(c(0, 20000))\n\nggplot(both, aes(x = Taste, y = Freq)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  ylim(c(0, 20000))\n\nggplot(both, aes(x = Smell, y = Freq)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  ylim(c(0, 20000))\n\n\n\nQUESTION 4: What do you conclude from the scatterplots?\n\n\nStep 4: The regression model\nWe are going to fit a Poisson regression model with Taste, Smell, Touch, Sight and Sound as predictors (all of these are continuous rating scales).\n\nTASK: Fit a Poisson regression model for ‘Freq’ as a function of ‘Taste’, ‘Smell’, ‘Touch’, ‘Sight’ and ‘Sound’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the glm() function with family = poisson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nfreqMod &lt;- glm(Freq ~ Sight + Taste + Smell + Sound + Touch,\n               data = both,\n               family = poisson)\n\nsummary(freqMod)\n\n\n\nQUESTION 5: How do you interpret the output of the Poisson regression?\n\n\nStep 5: Overdispersion\nIn the lecture we saw that it is possible that the variance is larger than theoretically expected for a given lambda. If this happens, we are dealing with what’s called ‘overdispersion’. You can compensate for this by using a variant of Poisson regression that is called ‘negative binomial regression’. In negative binomial regression the variance is uncouples from the mean.\n\nTASK: Fit a negative binomial regression model for ‘Freq’ as a function of ‘Taste’, ‘Smell’, ‘Touch’, ‘Sight’ and ‘Sound’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the glm.nb() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nfreqMod_nb &lt;- glm.nb(Freq ~ Sight + Taste + Smell + Sound + Touch,\n    data = both)\nsummary(freqMod_nb)\n\n\n\nNext, check whether there is significant overdispersion by performing a likelihood ratio test, comparing the likelihood of the negative binomial model against the likelihood of the corresponding Poisson model.\n\nTASK: Use the odTest() function to perform an ‘overdispersion’ test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the odTest() function and pass object that identifies your model as the argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nodTest(freqMod_nb)\n\n\n\nQUESTION 6: What do you conclude from the results of the overdispersion test?\nQUESTION 7: How do you interpret the negative binomial regression output? Do English speakers use visual adjectives more frequently? What about smell adjectives in comparison?",

    "text": "Answers\nWhen you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. Remember, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. Actively engaging with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else’s completed code…\n\nYou can download the R-script that includes the relevant code here: 412_wk15_labAct1_withAnswers.R.\n\nWhich variables do you need to address the research question? Our dependent variable is word frequency, so we need a variable that tells us how frequent words are. This information is contained in the English Lexicon Project data file, variable Log10Freq. The sensory modality ratings as reported in the in the data file supplied by Lynott and Connell (2009) are our predictors. That means we need the variables ‘Sight’, ‘Touch’, ‘Sound’, ‘Taste’, and ‘Smell’. You also need a variable that is common across the two files to help with merging them together (i.e., by  = ), this would be ‘Word’.\nWhich ‘join’ is most appropriate, the inner_join() or the left_join()? Also, does it matter which datafile you specify as x and which one as y? If so, why does it matter? A left_join() keeps all observations in table x, adding the information from table y for those observations. That means that it does matter which table you specify as x and which one as y. ELP contains word frequencies for many more words than we have sensory modality ratings for (in lyn). When specifying ELP as x, you keep 33075 rows, adding a lot of NAs for words we do not have sensory modality ratings for. Therefore it makes more sense to specify lyn as x, and add the word frequency information for the words we have sensory modality ratings for. An inner_join() matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal, and unmatched rows are not included in the result. This means that generally inner joins are not appropriate because it is too easy to lose observations.\nWhat does this line of code do. Write a comment to summarise its function.\n\n\nboth &lt;- mutate(both, Freq = 10 ^ Log10Freq)\n\nUse the mutate() function to add a variable Freq to the table both. Freq is derived from the variable Log10Freq by taking it to the power of 10. We do this because that reverses the log transformation and will therefore give us the raw values, all positive integers that we need for Poisson regression.\n\nWhat do you conclude from the scatterplots? Sight: moderate positive association - the visual rating is higher for more frequent words. Smell: weak negative association - when word frequency goes up, the smell rating goes down. There are a* lot of low smell ratings for adjectives (lots of dots clode to 0). Sound: weak positive association - when word frequency goes up, so does the sound rating. Touch: weak positive association - when word frequency goes up, so does the touch rating. Taste: no assocation - line is pretty much horizontal; similar to smell, there are a lot of low taste ratings (cluster of rating scores around 0).\nHow do you interpret the output of the Poisson regression? Estimate for Sight is indeed positive and largest (compared to the other predictors), while the estimate for Smell is negative and the estimate for Taste is very close to 0. All predictors are significant.\nWhat do you conclude from the results of the overdispersion test? The result of the overdispersion test is significant (p &lt; 2.2e-16), indicating that there is significant overdispersion. The negative binomial regression model is therefore more appropriate.\nHow do you interpret the negative binomial regression output? Do English speakers use visual adjectives more frequently? What about smell adjectives in comparison? The estimates for all predictors have now changed and not all of them are now significant. Also note that the standard errors of the estimates have increased substantially. Sight still shows a significant positive relationship with word frequency and has by far the largest estimate suggesting it contributes most. So, yes, English speakers use visual adjectives more frequently. For smell adjectives the estimate is negative and significant, suggesting that for more frequent words, the Smell ratings are smaller.",

    "text": "Pre-lab activities\nAfter having watched the lectures and read the textbook chapters you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\nPre-lab activity 1: Visualising the regression line\nHave a look at this visualisation of the regression line by Ryan Safner.\nIn this shiny app, you see a randomly-generated set of data points (within specific parameters, to keep the graph scaled properly). You can choose a slope and intercept for the regression line by using the sliders. The graph also displays the residuals as dashed red lines. Moving the slope or the intercept too much causes the generated line to create much larger residuals. The shiny app also calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) and the standard error of the regression (SER), which calculates the average size of the error (the red numbers). These numbers reflect how well the regression line fits the data, but you don’t need to worry about those for now.\nIn the app he uses the equation Y = aX + b in which b is the intercept and a is the slope.\nThis is slightly different from the equation you saw during the lecture. There we talked about Y = b0 + b1*X + e. Same equation, just different letters. So b0 in the lecture is equivalent to b in the app and b1 in the lecture is equivalent to a in the app.\nPre-lab activity questions:\n\nChange the slider for the intercept. How does it change the regression line?\nChange the slider for the slope. How does it change the regression line?\nWhat happens to the residuals (the red dashed lines) when you change the slope and the intercept of the regression line?\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 2: Data-wrangling in R\nData comes in lots of different formats. One of the most common formats is that of a two-dimensional table (the two dimensions being rows and columns). Usually, each row stands for a separate observation (e.g. a participant), and each column stands for a different variable (e.g. a response, category, or group). A key benefit of tabular data is that it allows you to store different types of data-numerical measurements, alphanumeric labels, categorical descriptors-all in one place.\nIt may surprise you to learn that scientists actually spend far more of time cleaning and preparing their data than they spend actually analysing it. This means completing tasks such as cleaning up bad values, changing the structure of tables, merging information stored in separate tables, reducing the data down to a subset of observations, and producing data summaries. Some have estimated that up to 80% of time spent on data analysis involves such data preparation tasks (Dasu & Johnson, 2003)!\nMany people seem to operate under the assumption that the only option for data cleaning is the painstaking and time-consuming cutting and pasting of data within a spreadsheet program like Excel. We have witnessed students and colleagues waste days, weeks, and even months manually transforming their data in Excel, cutting, copying, and pasting data. Fixing up your data by hand is not only a terrible use of your time, but it is error-prone and not reproducible. Additionally, in this age where we can easily collect massive datasets online, you will not be able to organise, clean, and prepare these by hand.\nIn short, you will not thrive as a psychologist if you do not learn some key data wrangling skills. Although every dataset presents unique challenges, there are some systematic principles you should follow that will make your analyses easier, less error-prone, more efficient, and more reproducible.\nSome of the functions you’ll need in this week’s lab activity are mentioned below. You’ve used these functions before, but the following recipes summarise what each one does and how to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipes - How to use them\n\n\n\nEach ‘recipe’ has the same structure.\n\nFirst, it summarises what it is that you want to achieve when using that specific function. In the case of select() it says “You want to extract specific columns from a data frame and return them as a new, smaller data frame.”\nThen, it outlines a number of steps that you need to carry out when using this function. For select() it outlines 2 steps: 1. Pass the dataframe to the function. 2. List the column(s) to return.\nFinally, there is an example talks you through using the function with some data. For select() it uses an example with data on the weather.\nAdditional information appears in extra boxes with a light-bulb icon. If you find those confusing, don’t worry about them at this stage.\n\n\n\n\nTASK Have a look at each ‘recipe’ and read through it. Try to understand each step.\n\n\nUnder R Basics, have a look at the recipe to Read a CSV file or remind yourself how to make sure to Obey R’s naming rules. Of course, you are very welcome to review other recipes in this category as well.\nReview the recipes in the Transform Tables category to remind yourself how to extract values from a table, calculate summary statistics, derive new variables and more by using dplyr verbs such as select(), filter(), mutate(), rename(), group_by() and summarise().\nUnder Visualize Data, you’ll find recipes to create a histogram or a scatterplot (and much more).\n\nPlease note that there are often different ways to do the same or similar things in R. This means you might encounter slightly different functions or styles of coding in different materials. This is not something to worry about. Just make sure you’re clear on what a bit of code achieves and choose the function/style that you feel most comfortable with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn the Posit recipes, you’ll see the function call for for instance read_csv() written as readr::read_csv(). This specifies the package or library the function is from (readr) as well as the function (read_csv()). As long as you have loaded the tidyverse library, you don’t need to load readr separately, because it is part of the tidyverse library. If you want to know more about the tidyverse library, see here.\n\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 3: Getting ready for the lab class\n\nRemind yourself of how to access and work with the RStudio Server.\n\nRevisit PSYC411 to remind yourself of how to access the RStudio Server.\n\n\n\nGet your files ready\nDownload the 412_week11_lab.zip folder and upload the files into a new folder in RStudio Server.",

One common measure of the source is pitch (otherwise called Fundamental Frequency or F0 (F-zero)) (Titze, 1994), which is a measure of the vibration of the vocal chords, in Hertz (Hz); males have on average a lower pitch than females for example. Likewise, one measure of the filter is called formant dispersion (measured again in Hz), and is effectively a measure of the length of someone’s vocal tract (or neck). Height and neck length are suggested to be negatively correlated with formant dispersion, so tall people tend to have smaller formant dispersion. So all in, the sound of your voice is thought to give some indication of what you look like.\nMore recently, work has focussed on what the sound of your voice suggests about your personality. McAleer, Todorov and Belin (2014) suggested that vocal acoustics give a perception of your trustworthiness and dominance to others, regardless of whether or not it is accurate. One extension of this is that trust may be driven by malleable aspects of your voice (e.g. your pitch) but not so much by static aspects of your voice (e.g. your formant dispersion). Pitch is considered malleable because you can control the air being pushed through your vocal chords (though you have no conscious control of your vocal chords), whereas dispersion may be controlled by the structure of your throat which is much more rigid due to muscle, bone, and other things that keep your head attached. This idea of certain traits being driven by malleable features and others by static features was previously suggested by Oosterhof and Todorov (2008) and has been tested with some validation by Rezlescu, Penton, Walsh, Tsujimura, Scott and Banissy (2015).\nSo, the research question today is: Can vocal acoustics, namely pitch and formant dispersion, predict perceived trustworthiness from a person’s voice? We will only look at male voices today, but you have the data for female voices as well should you wish to practice (note that in the field, tendency is to analyse male and female voices separately as they are effectively sexually dimorphic). As such, we hypothesise that a linear combination of pitch and dispersion will predict perceived vocal trustworthiness in male voices. This is what we will analyse.\nTo complete this lab activity, you can use the R-script (412_wk11_labAct2.R) that you downloaded as part of the ‘pre-lab activities’ as a template. Work through the activity below, adding relevant bits of code to your script as you go along.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Background and set up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet your working directory\n\n\n\nThe folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 3: Getting ready for the lab class’ contains the data files we’ll need. Make sure you have set your working directory to this folder by right-clicking on it and selecting ‘Set as working directory’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpty the R environment\n\n\n\nBefore you do anything else, when starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one. Use the code snippet below to clear the environment.\n\n\n\nrm(list=ls())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you hover your mouse over the box that includes the code snippet, a ‘copy to clipboard’ icon will appear in the top right corner of the box. Click that to copy the code. Now you can easily paste it into your script.\n\n\nBefore we can get started we need to tell R which libraries to use. For this analysis we’ll need broom, car, and tidyverse.\n\nTASK: Load the relevant libraries. If you are unsure how to do that, you can look at the ‘Hint’ below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\nIn this lab, we are setting out to test whether a linear combination of pitch and dispersion will predict perceived vocal trustworthiness in male voices. We’ll be working with two data files:\n\nvoice_acoustics.csv - shows the VoiceID, the sex of the voice, and the pitch and dispersion values\nvoice_ratings.csv - shows the VoiceID and the ratings of each voice by 28 participants on a scale of 1 to 9 where 9 was extremely trustworthy and 1 was extremely untrustworthy.\n\n\nTASK: Read in both files, have a look at the layout of the data and familiarise yourself with it. The ratings data is rather messy and in a different layout to the acoustics but can you tell what is what?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the read_csv() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nacoustics &lt;- read_csv(\"voice_acoustics.csv\")\nratings &lt;- read_csv(\"voice_ratings.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nQUESTION 1 How are the acoustics data and the ratings data organised (wide or long)? Are both data files ‘tidy’? If you need more info on what that means, have a look here.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Restructuring the ratings data\nWe are going to need to do some data-wrangling before we do any analysis! Specifically, we need the change the ratings data to the long format.\nHere we’ll use the pivot_longer() function (see here or type ?pivot_longer in the Console for more info) to restructure the ratings data from wide to long and store the resulting table as ‘ratings_tidy’.\n\nTASK: Use the code snippet below to restructure the data. Have a look at each line of code (and the comments in green) and check that you understand how it works.\n\n\nratings_tidy &lt;- pivot_longer(\n  data = ratings,    # the data you want to restructure\n  cols = P1:P28,     # columns you want to restructure\n  names_to = \"participant\", # variable name that captures whatever is across the columns\n  # (in this case P1 to P28 for the 28 different participants)\n  values_to = \"rating\") # variable name that captures whatever is in the cells\n  # (in this case numbers for ratings)\n\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate mean trustworthiness rating for each voice\nNow that we have the ratings data into a tidy format, the next step is to calculate the mean rating for each voice. Remember that each voice is identified by the ‘VoiceID’ variable.\n\nTASK: Calculate the mean rating for each voice and store the resulting table in a variable named ‘ratings_mean’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse group_by() and summarise(). Are you using the tidy data? Also, remember that if there are any missing values (NAs) then na.rm = TRUE would help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nratings_mean &lt;- ratings_tidy %&gt;%\n  group_by(VoiceID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating))\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Join the data together\nOk, before we get ahead of ourselves, in order to perform the regression analysis we need to combine the data from ‘ratings_mean’ (the mean ratings) with ‘acoustics’ (the pitch and dispersion ratings). Also, as we said, we only want to analyse male voices today.\n\nTASK: Join the two tables and keep only the data for the male voices, call the resulting table ‘joined’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the inner_join() function (making use of the variable that is common across both tables) to join. See here or type ?inner_join in the Console for more info. Use the filter() function to only keep male voices. Remember that the Boolean operator for exactly equal is ==.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\njoined &lt;- ratings_mean %&gt;%\n  inner_join(acoustics, \"VoiceID\") %&gt;%\n  filter(sex == \"M\")\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Spreading the data\nWe are starting to get an understanding of our data and we want to start thinking about the regression. However, the regression would be easier to work with if Pitch and Dispersion were in separate columns. This can be achieved using the pivot_wider() function (see here or type ?pivot_wider in the Console for more info). This is basically the inverse of pivot_longer(). It increases the number of columns and decreases the number of rows.\n\nTASK: Use the code snippet below to spread the data. Have a look at each line of code (and the comments in green) and check that you understand how it works.\n\n\njoined_wide &lt;- joined %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = measures, # name of the categorical column to spread\n    values_from = value) # name of the data to spread\n\n\nQUESTION 2 Why do we not need to specify within the pivot_wider() function which data to use?\n\n\n\nStep 6: Visualising the data\nAs always, it is a good idea to visualise your data.\n\nTASK: Now that we have all the variables in one place, make two scatterplots, one of mean trustworthiness rating with dispersion and one for mean trustworthiness rating and pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this you’ll need the ggplot() function together with geom_point() and geom_smooth(). Make sure to give your axes some sensible labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a template for the code. Make sure to specify the data frame and the relevant variables.\nggplot(DATA, aes(x = variable X, y = variable Y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs (y = \"Label for variable Y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(joined_wide, aes(x = Dispersion, y = mean_rating)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs (y = \"Mean Trustworthiness Rating\")\n\nggplot(joined_wide, aes(x = Pitch, y = mean_rating)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs (y = \"Mean Trustworthiness Rating\")\n\n\n\n\nQUESTION 3 Looking at the scatterplots, how would you describe the relationships between trustworthiness and dispersion and trustworthiness and pitch in terms of direction and strength? Which one of the two seems stronger?\n\n\n\nStep 7: Conducting and interpreting simple regression\nWith all the variables in place and having gained a better understanding of our data by inspecting the scatterplots, we’re ready now to start building two simple linear regression models:\n\nPredicting trustworthiness mean ratings from Pitch\nPredicting trustworthiness mean ratings from Dispersion\n\n\nTASK: Use the lm() function to run the following two regression models and use the summary() function to look at the output of each model. Store the first model in a table called ‘mod_pitch’ and store the second model in ‘mod_disp’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a template for the code. Make sure to specify the data frame and the relevant variables.\nlm(dv ~ iv, data = my_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nmod_disp &lt;- lm(mean_rating ~ Dispersion, joined_wide)\nmod_disp_sum &lt;- summary(mod_disp)\n\nmod_pitch &lt;- lm(mean_rating ~ Pitch, joined_wide)\nmod_pitch_sum &lt;- summary(mod_pitch)\n\n\n\n\nQUESTION 4 What do you conclude from the output of these models? Which model is significant? Which predictors are significant? How much variance does each model describe?\n\n\n\nStep 8: Conducting and interpreting multiple regression\nNow let’s look at both predictors in the same model. Before we do this, it is sensible to center and standardise the predictors.\nLook at the code below. Can you follow how the predictors are first centered (_c) and then standardised (_z)?\nHere I do this by hand because I think it makes it clearer, even though there are functions that do this in one step (scale()).\n\njoined_wide &lt;- mutate(joined_wide,\n                      Dispersion_c = Dispersion - mean(Dispersion),\n                      Dispersion_z = Dispersion_c / sd(Dispersion_c),\n                      Pitch_c = Pitch - mean(Pitch),\n                      Pitch_z = Pitch_c / sd(Pitch_c))\n\n\nTASK: Now use the centered and standardised data for the multiple regression. Use the lm() function to run a model for predicting trustworthiness mean ratings from Pitch and Dispersion, and store the model in ‘mod_pitchdisp_z’. Use the ‘summary()’ function to look at the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a template for the code. Make sure to specify the data frame and the relevant variables.\nlm(dv ~ iv1 + iv2, data = my_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nmod_pitchdisp_z &lt;- lm(mean_rating ~ Pitch_z + Dispersion_z, joined_wide)\nmod_pitchdisp_z_sum &lt;- summary(mod_pitchdisp_z)\n\n\n\n\nQUESTION 5 What do you conclude from the output of this model? Is the overall model significant? Which predictors are significant? How much variance does the model describe? Which model would you say is best for predicting ratings of trustworthiness, the Pitch only, the Dispersion only or the Pitch+Dispersion model?\n\n\n\nStep 9: Checking assumptions\nNow that we’ve established which model best fits the data, let’s check whether it meets the assumptions of linearity, normality and homoscedasticity.\n\nTASK: Check the assumptions of linearity, normality and homoscedasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the crPlots() and the qqPlot() functions to check linearity. The shapiro.test() can be used to check normality of the residuals and the residualPlot() and nvcTest() functions to check homoscedasticity of the residuals. These plots are from base R rather than using the ggplot() function. See here for a brief explanation of base R plots and why you might want to use them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\ncrPlots(mod_pitch)\n\nqqPlot(mod_pitch$residuals)\nshapiro.test(mod_pitch$residuals)\n\nresidualPlot(mod_pitch)\nncvTest(mod_pitch)\n\n\n\n\nQUESTION 6 What do you conclude from the graphs and output? Should we also check for collinearity?\n\n\n\nStep 10: Writing up the results\n\nTASK: Write up the results following APA guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Purdue writing lab website is helpful for guidance on punctuating statistics. The APA Style 7th Edition Numbers and Statistics Guide is also useful.",

Remember, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. Actively engaging with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else’s completed code…\n\n\nLab activity 1: Interpreting and reporting results\n\nWhat is the outcome or dependent variable? Word reading\nWhat is the predictor or independent variable? Non-word reading\nIs the overall model significant? Yes, F(1,50) = 69.03, p &lt; .001\nHow much variance does the model account for? 58%\nDoes the relationship appear linear? Yes. The dots and the pink line assemble quite closely on the dashed line.\nDo the residuals show normality and homoscedasticity? The qq-plot suggests that the residuals are normally distributed as the dots fall close to the solid blue line and within the range of the dashed blue lines. The Shapiro-Wilk test of normality confirms this (it is not significant). Similarly, the output of the non-constant variance score tests is not significant suggesting that the residuals are homoscedastic.\n\n\n\nLab activity 2: Conducting simple and multiple regression\nYou can download the R-script that includes the relevant code and answers to the questions here: 412_wk11_labAct2_withAnswers.R.",

    "text": "So far, all the predictors in the models we’ve looked at were continuous variables. What if you wanted to know whether a response differed between two or more discrete groups? Hang on, you might say, that sounds like doing an ANOVA. True, you might have used ANOVA to assess whether group means differed in previous stats courses. ANOVAs—to some degree—are just a special type of regression where you have categorical predictors. This week we’ll look at how to model responses as a function of categorical predictors and we’ll combine categorical predictors to model how a predictor might affect the outcome variable differently across two different groups. For example, we might be interested in whether the amount of time adolescents use digital devices (screen-time) predicts their well-being. Additionally, we might want to know whether well-being is different for adolescent boys and girls and whether the relationship between screen-time and well-being differs for these two groups. By fitting a regression model in which we combine a continuous (screen-time) and a categorical (sex) predictor, we can do exactly that. We’ll be working on that in the lab.",

    "text": "Pre-lab activities\nAfter having watched the lectures and read the textbook chapters you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\nPre-lab activity 1: More data-wrangling in R\nWe’ll continue to practice data-wrangling in R. This week, we’ll work with some questionnaire data. You might have collected questionnaire data using Qualtrics, Pavlovia or Gorilla. The data we’ll be working with in this pre-lab activity were collected using the Gorilla platform. The questionnaire collects some demographic information. A data collection platform typically provides you with an output file that is quite complex. For instance, in addition to responses to the questions of interest, it will collect information on task name, task version, various time stamps and other information on the data collection session. To be able to do any statistics on the data, you’ll have to extract the relevant information from this larger data file. We can do this by using various functions from the dplyr package. This cheatsheet provides a useful overview.\n\nStep 1: Background and set up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet your working directory\n\n\n\nMake sure you have set your working directory to the correct folder by right-clicking on it and selecting ‘Set as working directory’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpty the R environment\n\n\n\nBefore you do anything else, when starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one. To do this, you can click on the little broom icon in the top right of the Environment pane, or you can use rm(list=ls()).\n\n\nBefore we can get started we need to tell R which libraries to use. For this analysis we’ll need tidyverse.\n\nTASK: Load the relevant libraries. If you are unsure how to do that, you can look at the ‘Hint’ below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you couldn’t upload files to the server, do this:\n\n\n\nIf you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the ‘clipboard’ in the top right corner.\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/lu-psy-r/MSc/blob/main/PSYC412/part1/Week12-files/data_exp_72623-v17_questionnaire-i5jp.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"data_exp_72623-v17_questionnaire-i5jp.csv\")\n\n\nTASK: Read in the data file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the read_csv() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\ndemo &lt;- read_csv(\"data_exp_72623-v17_questionnaire-i5jp.csv\")                                   \n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Have a look what is in this file\nThe first thing to do when developing an R-script to clean up data prior to data analysis is to have a look what is in the file and identify the rows and columns that you need.\n\nTASK: View the data file. See whether you can identify which columns we need to extract the questionnaire responses. If you are unsure how to do that, you can look at the ‘Hint’ below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use View() to open the file in a separate tab. You can also inspect the file by using the head() function to look at the first few rows or the glimpse() function to get an overview of all rows and columns. Type ?head or ?dplyr::glimpse in the Console to get more information about those functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nView(demo)                                  # Look at the data frames\nhead(demo)\nglimpse(demo)\n\n\n\nYou’ll find that the data file has 31 columns and 157 rows. The questionnaire responses are in the last column (Response). Additionally, we need information in the column Question Key to make sure we extract the labels associated with the responses. Finally, we need participant numbers (stored in Participant Private ID) to be able to link responses to a particular participant.\n\n\nStep 3: Extract relevant columns and rows\n\nTASK: Extract the columns Participant Private ID, Question Key and Response, and assign the result to a new data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the select() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nselect(`Participant Private ID`, `Question Key`, `Response`)\n\n\n\nYou’ll see that the new data frame still has 157 observations or rows, but now we only have a much more manageable 3 variables or columns. If you scroll through the data file, you’ll see that the responses from different participants are in separate rows (meaning that the data are in ‘long’ format). You’ll also see that it separates different participants by rows with the text “BEGIN QUESTIONNAIRE” and “END QUESTIONNAIRE”. We need to get rid of those before we transform the data frame to a ‘wide’ format.\n\nTASK: Extract all rows, except ones that have “BEGIN QUESTIONNAIRE” or “END QUESTIONNAIRE” in the column Question Key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the filter() function, in combination with the logical operator for ‘not’. See here for more info on logical operators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nfilter(!`Question Key` == \"BEGIN QUESTIONNAIRE\")\nfilter(!`Question Key` == \"END QUESTIONNAIRE\")\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Change the format from ‘long’ to ‘wide’\nNow that we’ve cleaned up the column and rows, we want to change the format to wide to have a separate column for each question, and have one row per participant.\n\nTASK: Change the format to wide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the pivot_wider() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\npivot_wider(names_from = `Question Key`, values_from = Response)\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Rename variables\nHave another look at the data frame. We now have separate columns for different questions such as participant number, age, gender etc. However, some of the columns have awkward names, consisting of multiple words (such as ‘Participant Private ID’). Let’s rename those to make it easier to work with. Also note that we have data for 10 participants. For the purpose of this exercise, we’ll focus on the variables age, gender, language background and handedness. So don’t worry about renaming the other ones.\n\nTASK: Rename the variables that have multi-word names. Focus on age, gender, language background and handedness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the rename() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nrename(origID = `Participant Private ID`,\n         age = Age,\n         gender = Gender,\n         gender_text = `Gender-text`,\n         bilingual_text = `bilingual-text`,\n         handedness = categorical_hand) %&gt;%\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Extract variables\n\nTASK: Extract the following variables: age, gender (as well the associated text variable), language background (as well as the associated text variable) and handedness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the select() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nselect(origID, age, gender, gender_text, bilingual, bilingual_text, handedness)\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Recode gender and bilingual\nIf you look at the gender variable, you’ll see that it has 3 levels: ‘Male’, ‘Female’ and ‘Other (please specify)’. There are 2 issues with this: 1) Male and female are labels associated with biological sex, rather than gender. These labels should be recoded to ‘Man’ and ‘Woman’; 2) The third label reads ‘Other (please specify)’. While a necessary part of the question, we don’t really want the ‘(please specify)’ part to show in tables and figures. We will want to recode that to just ‘Other’. Similarly, for the bilingual variable, we have ‘Yes. My strongest language is:’ and ‘No’. We will want to recode that to a simpler ‘Yes’ and ‘No’.\n\nTASK: Recode the levels of the gender variable to ‘Man, ’Woman’ and ‘Other’, rather than ‘Male’, ‘Female and ’Other (please specify)’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the recode() function, in combination with the mutate() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to fill in the template below:\nmutate (new variable = recode(old variable,\n                              `Old label1` = \"New label1\",\n                              `Old label2` = \"New label2\",\n                              `Old label3` = \"New label3\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nmutate (gender = dplyr::recode(gender,\n                               `Male` = \"Man\",\n                               `Female` = \"Woman\",\n                               `Other (please specify)` = \"Other\")) %&gt;%\nmutate(bilingual = dplyr::recode(bilingual,\n                                 `Yes. My strongest language is:` = \"Yes\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 8: Change variable types\nSomething else to check at this stage is whether the variable types that R has automatically assigned to your variables are correct. An easy way to check what the variable type for each variable is, is by clicking on the white triangle in the blue circle next to the object name in the Environment. Using the glimpse() function will also show them. You will see that each variable is a ‘num’ (for ‘numerical’) or ‘chr’ (for ‘character’). Specifically, currently R thinks that the values stored in ‘origID’ are numerical values and that the values stored in all other variables are ‘character’ values (basically reading them as strings). This is not correct. Participant numbers, gender and bilingual are really factors with different levels (or categories) and the values in ‘age’ are numerical values. This is important, because certain functions expect variables of a certain type. For instance, you can’t compute the mean of a variable that consists of ‘characters’. So if you don’t change the variable types and try to compute the mean of ‘age’ it will not work. You can read more about variable types in R here.\n\nTASK: Change the variable types for participant number (factor), age (numerical), gender (factor), and bilingual (factor). Note that the variables ‘gender_text’ and ‘bilingual_text’ indeed contain string information, so are correctly identified as ‘character’ variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the as.factor() and as.numeric() functions, in combination with the mutate() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to fill in the template below:\nmutate(variable1 = as.factor(variable1),\n       variable2 = as.numeric(variable2),\n       variable3 = as.factor(variable3),\n       variable4 = as.factor(variable4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nmutate(origID = as.factor(origID),\n       age = as.numeric(age),\n       gender = as.factor(gender),\n       handedness = as.factor(handedness))\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 9: Save processed file\nNow the data is in a much better shape to work with for data visualisation, combination with other data files and analysis. In my own work, I’d write a separate ‘cleaning’ script like this for each measure (questionnaire or experimental task) and store the cleaned data frame as a new data file. I can then easily read in those ‘cleaned’ data files when doing further visualisation or analysis, without having to touch the raw data files again.\n\nTASK: Store the data frame that contains the ‘cleaned’ or ‘processed’ data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the write_csv() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nwrite_csv(demo_proc, (\"Week12-files/demo_proc.csv\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can download the R-script that combines all these bits of code into 1 pipe here. It is always a good idea to build a pipe like this 1 line at a time. Make sure to check that each line actually does what you expect it to do before you add the next line.\n\n\n\nWell done! The more you practise data wrangling, the easier it will become.\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class\n\nGet your files ready\nDownload the 412_week12_lab.zip file.\n\n\nRemind yourself of how to access and work with the RStudio Server.\n\nSign in to the RStudio Server. Note that when you are not on campus you need to log into the VPN first (look on the portal if you need more information about that).\nCreate a new folder for this week’s work.\nUpload the zip-file to the folder you have created on the RStudio server. Note you can either upload a single file or a zip-file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have difficulty uploading files to the server\n\n\n\nIf you get error messages when attempting to upload a file or a folder with files to the server, you can try the following steps:\n\nClose the R Studio server, close your browser and start afresh.\nOpen the R Studio server in a different browser.\nFollow a work around where you use code to directly download the file to the server. The code to do that will be available at the start of the lab activity where you need that particular file. The code to download the file you need to complete the quiz is below.",

    "text": "Lab activities\nIn this lab, you’ll gain understanding of and practice with:\n\nwhen and why to apply multiple regression to answer questions in psychological science\nconducting multiple regression in R when combining continuous and categorical predictors\ninterpreting the R output of multiple linear regression (when combining continuous and categorical predictors)\nreporting results for multiple linear regression (when combining continuous and categorical predictors), following APA guidelines\n\n\nLab activity 1: Combining a continuous and a categorical predictor in a regression model\n\nBackground: Smartphone screen-time and well-being\nThere is currently much debate (and hype) surrounding smartphones and their effects on well-being, especially with regard to children and teenagers. We’ll be looking at data from this recent study of English adolescents: Przybylski, A. & Weinstein, N. (2017). A Large-Scale Test of the Goldilocks Hypothesis. Psychological Science, 28, 204–215.\nThis was a large-scale study that found support for the “Goldilocks” hypothesis among adolescents: that there is a “just right” amount of screen-time, such that any amount more or less than this amount is associated with lower well-being. This was a huge survey study with data containing responses from over 120,000 participants! Fortunately, the authors made the data from this study openly available, which allows us to dig deeper into their results. And the question we want to expand on in this lab is whether the relationship between screen-time and well-being depends on the partcipant’s (self-reported) sex. In other words, our research question is: Does screen-time have a bigger impact on boys or girls, or is it the same for both?\nThe dependent measure used in the study was the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). This is a 14-item scale with 5 response categories, summed together to form a single score ranging from 14-70.\nOn Przybylski & Weinstein’s page for this study on the Open Science Framework, you can find the participant survey, which asks a large number of additional questions (see page 14 for the WEMWBS questions and pages 4-5 for the questions about screen-time). Within the same page you can also find the raw data, which some of you might want to consider using for your research report.\nHowever, for the purpose of this lab, you will be using local pre-processed copies of the data (participant_info.csv, screen_time.csv and `wellbeing.csv, which you downloaded as part of the ‘Pre-lab activities’.\nPrzybylski and Weinstein looked at multiple measures of screen-time, but again for the interests of this lab we will be focusing on smartphone use, but do feel free to expand your skills after by looking at different definitions of screen-time. Overall, Przybylski and Weinstein suggested that decrements in well-being started to appear when respondents reported more than one hour of daily smartphone use. So, bringing it back to our additional variable of sex, our research question is now: Does the negative association between hours of smartphone use and well-being (beyond the one-hour point) differ for boys and girls?\nLet’s think about this in terms of the variables. We have:\n\na continuous outcome variable: well-being;\na continuous∗ predictor variable: screen-time;\na categorical predictor variable: sex.\n\nPlease note that well-being and screen-time are technically only quasi-continuous inasmuch as that only discrete values are possible. However, there are a sufficient number of discrete categories in our data that we can treat the data as effectively continuous.\nNow, in terms of analysis, what we are effectively trying to do is to estimate two slopes relating screen-time to well-being, one for adolescent girls and one for adolescent boys, and then statistically compare these slopes. Sort of like running a correlation for boys, a correlation for girls, and comparing the two. Or alternatively, where you would run a regression (to estimate the slopes) but also one where you would need a t-test (to compare two groups). But the expressive power of regression allows us to do this all within a single model. Again, as we have seen building up to this lab, an independent groups t-test is just a special case of ordinary regression with a single categorical predictor; ANOVA is just a special case of regression where all predictors are categorical. But remember, although we can express any ANOVA design using regression, the converse is not true: we cannot express every regression design in ANOVA. As such people like regression, and the general linear model, as it allows us to have any combination of continuous and categorical predictors in the model. The only inconvenience with running ANOVA models as regression models is that you have to take care in how you numerically code the categorical predictors. We will use an approach called deviation coding which we will look at today later in this lab.\nTo complete this lab activity, you can use the R-script (402_wk12_labAct1_template.R) that you downloaded as part of the ‘Pre-lab activities’ as a template. Work through the activity below, adding relevant bits of code to your script as you go along.\n\n\nStep 1: Background and set up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet your working directory\n\n\n\nThe folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 3: Getting ready for the lab class’ contains the data files we’ll need. Make sure you have set your working directory to this folder by right-clicking on it and selecting ‘Set as working directory’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpty the R environment\n\n\n\nBefore you do anything else, when starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one. To do this, you can click on the little broom icon in the top right of the Environment pane, or you can use rm(list=ls()).\n\n\nBefore we can get started we need to tell R which libraries to use. For this analysis we’ll need broom, car and tidyverse.\n\nTASK: Load the relevant libraries. If you are unsure how to do that, you can look at the ‘Hint’ below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you couldn’t upload files to the server, do this:\n\n\n\nIf you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the ‘clipboard’ in the top right corner.\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/mg78/2324_PSYC402/blob/main/data/week12/participant_info.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"participant_info.csv\")\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/mg78/2324_PSYC402/blob/main/data/week12/screen_time.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"screen_time.csv\")\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/mg78/2324_PSYC402/blob/main/data/week12/wellbeing.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"wellbeing.csv\")\n\n\nTASK: Finally, read in the three data files; call the participant info pinfo; call the screen_time data screen and the well-being data wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the read_csv() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\npinfo &lt;- read_csv(\"participant_info.csv\")                                   \nscreen &lt;- read_csv(\"screen_time.csv\")\nwellbeing &lt;- read_csv(\"wellbeing.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Checking the formatting\nGiven our research question and the information you have about the scores, provided above under ‘Background’ and from the OSF-webpage, is the data ready for use?\n\nTASK: Add code to look at the first few lines of each data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the head() function (or tail() function).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nhead(pinfo)                                  # Look at the data frames\nhead(screen)\nhead(wellbeing)\n\n\n\n\nQUESTION 2a: In which table is the variable corresponding to sex located and what is this variable called?\n\nThe ‘source and analysis code.sps’ file in the ‘Data and Code’ section on the OSF-webpage tells us how they coded the sex variable: 0 = female indicator and 1 = male indicator. It is worth exploring the OSF-webpage, to get used to foraging other files for these kinds of information, as they are not always clearly explained in a codebook or README. file.\n\nTASK: For ease, lets recode the sex variable to reflect word labels of ‘female’ and ‘male’. This doesn’t change the order: R will still see female as 0, and male as 1 because female occurs before male in the alphabet. Make sure to check your code does what you expect it to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the recode() function from the dplyr package to recode the labels. Use the head() and tail() functions to check the new data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\n\npinfo &lt;- pinfo %&gt;%\n  mutate (sex = dplyr::recode(sex,\n                              `1` = \"male\",\n                              `0` = \"female\"))\n# Let's check it has done it:\nhead(pinfo)\ntail(pinfo)\n\n\n\n\nQUESTION 2b: In what format is the well-being data (long or wide)? On how many participants does it include observations? And on how many items for each participant?\n\n\nQUESTION 2c: What is the name of the variable that identifies individual participants in this dataset? It is important to work this out as this variable will allow us to link information across the three data files.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Data preparation - Aggregating the total well-being scores\nWe need to sum the 14 items of the well-being scale for each participant to create one well-being score per participant.\n\nTASK: To create one well-being score per participant, add code to the script to do the following: first, transform the well-being data frame from wide to long (using pivot_longer()); then, use group_by() to get scores for each participant and finally use summarise() to calculate a total well-being score, calling the new variable tot_wellbeing. Save all of this to an object called wb_tot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a code template. Make sure to add the relevant sections.\nwb_tot &lt;- DATA %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-Serial, names_to = \"\", values_to = \"\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(?) %&gt;%\n  summarise(tot_wellbeing = sum(?))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nwb_tot &lt;- wellbeing %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-Serial, names_to = \"question\", values_to = \"score\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Serial) %&gt;%\n  summarise(tot_wellbeing = sum(score))\n\n\n\nIt is useful to calculate some descriptive statistics for the new variable tot_wellbeing.\n\nTASK: Calculate some descriptive statistics for tot_wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse summarise() to calculate the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nwb_tot %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(tot_wellbeing),\n                     sd = sd(tot_wellbeing),\n                     min = min(tot_wellbeing), \n                     max = max(tot_wellbeing))\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s get an idea of the distribution of the new variable tot_wellbeing.\n\nTASK: Visualise the distribution in a histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse ggplot() and geom_historgram().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(wb_tot, aes(tot_wellbeing)) +\n  geom_histogram() \n\n\n\n\nQUESTION 3a: Is the distribution of well-being scores symmetrical, negatively skewed or positively skewed?\n\n\n\nStep 4: Data preparation - Transforming screen time data\nGreat, so we have the well-being scores sorted out, we now need to think about the screen-time usage data and whether it is being used on a weekday or a weekend. As always, to get an idea of the data, it is often very useful to visualise the variables before proceeding with the analysis.\nBefore we can do this, we’ll need to tidy these data up. Have another look at the screen data by using the head() function. You’ll see that we have Serial in the first column (this is good), but in the following eight columns, we have columns for each type of activity (Comph, Comp, Smart, Watch) and the part of the week it took place (we and wk) combined. Instead, to be able to work with the data, we need two columns: one for the type of activity (we’ll call it variable) and one for the part of the week (we’ll call it day).\nA second issue is that we need to alter the abbreviations Comph, Comp, Smart and Watch to reflect more descriptive text for each in plots.\nBelow are two chunks of code that represent these steps. In the next tasks you’ll practise with taking a set of piped commands apart. The purpose of this is to get you used to “parsing” the code at the right places so that when you see piped commands in other people’s code, you know how to break it down and find the relevant parts that you can use.\n\nTASK: In the code chunk below we use the separate() function to split the character strings already in the dataset. You know that with piped commands, there are chunks of code. Run the code first in its entirety and then pull each line apart to see how each function works on the data. Write a descriptive sentence for each function’s role in the command. Don’t forget to copy the chunk to your script and run it.\n\n\nscreen_long &lt;- screen %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-Serial, names_to = \"var\", values_to = \"hours\") %&gt;%\n  separate(var, c(\"variable\", \"day\"), \"_\")\n\n\nTASK: In the next code chunk we use the dplyr::recode() function with mutate() to relabel the separated names into understandable names that will be clear in plots. Again, run the code first in its entirety and then pull each line apart to see how each function works on the data. Write a descriptive sentence for each function’s role in the command. Don’t forget to copy the chunk to your script and run it.\n\n\nscreen2 &lt;- screen_long %&gt;%\n  mutate(variable = dplyr::recode(variable,\n                                  \"Watch\" = \"Watching TV\",\n                                  \"Comp\" = \"Playing Video Games\",\n                                  \"Comph\" = \"Using Computers\",\n                                  \"Smart\" = \"Using Smartphone\"),\n         day = dplyr::recode(day,\n                             \"wk\" = \"Weekday\",\n                             \"we\" = \"Weekend\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe code above has a new feature: the dplyr::recode part. This syntax – using the double colon – happens when there are many versions of a function with the same name. You can imagine that a function called ‘recode’ is immensely useful at the data wrangling stage of analysis. By using the name of the package, a double set of colons, followed by a function name, you are ensuring that R uses a particular version of the function, at that point only. This avoids having two or more packages loaded in your environment that sometimes do not play nicely together!\n\n\nTo be able to monitor that your code is performing as you want it to, you need to have in your mind an idea of how the data should look at the end of a code chunk. So stop a moment and be clear, discuss with your lab-mates if you feel like it and answer the following question.\n\nQUESTION 4a: What are the variables and the levels or conditions within each variable of screen2?\n\n\nTASK:Now join wb_tot and screen_2 by participant and then group by the variables ‘variable’, ‘day’ and ‘hours’ and then calculate a ‘mean_wellbeing’ variable for each of the grouped levels. Save it in an object called ‘dat_means’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite separate lines of code for each action and then, when you know each of them works, reformat them as a piped command. You’ll need inner_join(), group_by() and summarise().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow templates for separate lines of code for each action. You’ll need to replace the names of relevant data frames and variables.\njoined &lt;- inner_join(data1, data2, by=)\ngrouped &lt;- group_by(data, var1, var2, var3)\nmeans &lt;- summarise(data, mean = mean(variable))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow the code for a piped command.\ndat_means &lt;- inner_join(wb_tot, screen2, \"Serial\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(variable, day, hours) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_wellbeing = mean(tot_wellbeing))\n\n\n\n\nTASK: Now check that you have an object that is 72 observations of 4 variables. You should have a mean wellbeing score for every level of the hours, over weekdays and weekends for each level of the four types of screen time (4 x 2 x 9)\n\nNext, it is a good idea to visualise the mean well-being data as function of hours of screen-time for the different days (weekday vs. weekend) and types of screen (playing video games, using computers, using smartphone and watching tv). This is quite a complex graph. We’ll go through creating it step-by-step, but let’s first look at the end result:\n\nOk, that’s what we are working towards.\n\nTASK: Below, a chunk of code is presented. It is your task to fill in the x and y variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back to the research question - which variable is for the x axis and for the y axis?\n\n\n\n\nggplot(dat_means, aes(x = , y = )) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(dat_means, aes(x = hours, y = mean_wellbeing,)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\nQUESTION 4b: What research question does this plot describe? Is it appropriate for the levels within the data?\n\nTASK: Now, let’s add a different linetype for each day (weekday vs. weekend). Fill in the blanks in the code below.\n\n\nggplot(dat_means, aes(x = , y = , linetype = )) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(dat_means, aes(x = hours, y = mean_wellbeing, linetype = day)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\nQUESTION 4c: What research question does this plot describe? Is it appropriate for the levels within the data?\nStill not quite there.\n\nTASK: Fill in the blanks (for x, y and linetype) as before. Now have a good look at the code below. What has changed? Copy the code to your script and run it. Then, for each line write a sentence as a comment to describe its effect on the plot.\n\n\nggplot(dat_means, aes(x = , y = , linetype = )) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, nrow = 2) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(dat_means, aes(hours, mean_wellbeing, linetype = day)) + # plot 'hours' on the x-axis, 'mean_wellbeing' on the y-axis and use a different type of line for the levels of 'day'\n  geom_line() + # add a line\n  geom_point() + # add point data\n  facet_wrap(~variable, nrow = 2) + # plot separate plots for each level of 'variable'\n  theme_bw() # use the 'black and white' theme\n\n\n\nWe add the facet_wrap() function here. You can check the ?facet_wrap() help page for more information.\nQUESTION 4d: c. What does the facet_wrap() function do? Is this plot appropriate for the levels in the data?\n\n\nStep 5: Calculating mean hours per day for smartphone use, for each participant\nAs mentioned at the beginning, in today’s lab we’ll focus on smartphone use. So looking at the bottom left of the figure we could suggest that smartphone use of more than 1 hour per day is associated with increasingly negative well-being the longer screen time people have. This looks to be a similar effect for Weekdays and Weekends, though perhaps overall well-being in Weekdays is marginally lower than in Weekends (the line for Weekday is lower on the y-axis than Weekends). This makes some sense as people tend to be happier on Weekends!\n\nTASK: Below is a set of comments that describe what the chunk of code that you need to write next does:\n\n\n\n#use ‘screen2’\n#and then filter out the observations for ‘Using Smartphone’,\n#and then group together each participant,\n#and then summarise the mean hours calling it ‘hours_per_day’,\n#save it in an object called ‘smarttot’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a template for the code you need. Try to fill in the relevant bits:\nNEW_OBJECT &lt;- DATA %&gt;%\n  filter(variable == \"?\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(VARIABLE) %&gt;%\n  summarise(new_measure = mean(VARIABLE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below:\nsmarttot &lt;- screen2 %&gt;% # use 'screen2'\n  filter(variable == \"Using Smartphone\") %&gt;% # filter out the observations for 'Using Smartphone'\n  group_by(Serial) %&gt;% # group together each participant\n  summarise(hours_per_day = mean(hours)) #summarise the mean hours calling it 'hours_per_day'\n\n\n\n\nTASK: Now let’s do it the other way around. Run the code below. Have a look at the structure of ‘smart_wb’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the str() function.\n\n\n\n\nsmart_wb &lt;- smarttot %&gt;%\n  filter(hours_per_day &gt; 1) %&gt;%\n  inner_join(wb_tot, \"Serial\") %&gt;%\n  inner_join(pinfo, \"Serial\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex))\n\n\nQUESTION 5a: What does the code do? Write a short paragraph, using the phrase “and then” to represent the pipes.\n\n\n\nStep 6: More visualisation\nWe are now using only one small part of the data - smartphone use and its relationship with well-being over different durations of time. Before formally testing our research question, we can visualise the data and enquire about sex differences on the same plot - run each chunk of code below:\n\nTASK To further group the data, copy the code below to your script and run it. Look at the ‘smart_wb_gen’ dataframe. What has the code above done? Write a couple of sentences of description.\n\n\nsmart_wb_gen &lt;- smart_wb %&gt;%\n  group_by(hours_per_day, sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_wellbeing = mean(tot_wellbeing))\n\n\nTASK: Let’s visualise these data.\n\n\nggplot(smart_wb_gen, aes(hours_per_day, mean_wellbeing, color = sex)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Sex\", labels = c(\"Girls\", \"Boys\"))+\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Total hours smartphone use\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(name = \"Mean well-being score\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\nQUESTION 6a: Write an interpretation of the above plot in plain English.\n\n\n\nStep 7: The regression model\nIn the steps 2 to 6 we’ve covered some pretty heavy-lifting data-wrangling. As it is so often the case that something like this is needed when working with real data, it is really important to practise this. However, to ensure you also spend time on fitting the regression model and interpreting the output, you can choose to use the data-file smart_wb.csv to get started with that. It contains the data in a format that is the result of all the data-wrangling we did in steps 2 to 6. So, download the smart_sb.csv data-file, put it in the folder that is your working directory and you’re all set for running the regression model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you couldn’t upload files to the server, do this:\n\n\n\nIf you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the ‘clipboard’ in the top right corner.\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/mg78/2324_PSYC402/blob/main/data/week12/smart_wb.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"smart_wb.csv\")\n\n\nTASK: Let’s run the regression. Write code in your script in which you call your output ‘mod’, and use the data ‘smart_wb’ using the following formula, lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2, data) to construct your regression model. Go back to the research question for your outcome and two predictor variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the following template:\nmod &lt;- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2, data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nmod &lt;- lm(tot_wellbeing ~ hours_per_day + sex + hours_per_day:sex, smart_wb)\n\n\n\n\nTASK: Call and save the summary of your model as ‘mod_summary’; then have a look at it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nmod_summary &lt;- summary(mod)\nmod_summary\n\n\n\nLet’s first look at the model as a whole:\n\nQUESTION 7a: What is the p-value for the overall model? Is it significant? What does this mean?\n\n\nQUESTION 7b: To two decimal places, what percentage of the variance in well-being scores does the overall model explain?\n\nNow, lets look at the coefficients of our predictors:\n\nQUESTION 7c: Are the main effects of smartphone use and sex significant?\n\n\nQUESTION 7d: Which variable indicates the interaction between smartphone use and sex?\n\n\nQUESTION 7e: And is the interaction significant?\n\n\nQUESTION 7f: What is the most reasonable interpretation of these results?\n\nThe above model uses treatment coding (sometimes called dummy coding), for the sex variable. In a categorical variable with only two levels this means that one level is coded as 0 and the other level is coded as 1. In categorical variables with more than two levels, it works slightly differently.\n\nTASK: We can check that the sex variable is treatment with the following code:\n\n\ncontrasts(smart_wb$sex)\n\nBecause we have not explicitly told R about the labels for the sex variable, it has used level 0 as the reference level, hidden within the intercept term and level sex1 describes the difference (or slope) between level 0 and 1 or in this dataset from female to male.\n\nQUESTION 7g: Is being Male better for a person’s well-being in the context of smartphone use than being Female?\n\nNow let’s look at deviation coding. There are other ways to code your categorical variables. One of them is deviation coding (also sometimes called sum coding). This effectively divides the difference of the values between your categorical levels by the number of levels so that each level can be compared to one intercept that is central to them all rather than comparing levels to one reference level. It is like centering for a categorical level.\n\nTASK Use the code chunk below to: 1) Add a variable to the smart_wb data that is a deviation coding of sex; 2) Set the deviation coding (we’ll label it ‘Sum’ here for easy variable naming); and 3) Look at the output for the sum-coded sex variable.\n\n\nsmart_wb &lt;- mutate(smart_wb, sexSum = sex) # add a variable to the smart_wb data that is a deviation coding of sex\ncontrasts(smart_wb$sexSum) &lt;- contr.sum(2) # wet the deviation coding\ncontrasts(smart_wb$sexSum) # look at the output for the sum coded sex variable\n\nNext, we’ll run the regression again, using the sum-coded sex variable and we’ll compare the outputs.\n\n# Run the regression model again, using the sumcoded sex model and compare outputs\nmod_S &lt;- lm(tot_wellbeing ~ hours_per_day + sexSum + hours_per_day:sexSum, smart_wb)\nmod_S_summary &lt;- summary(mod_S)\n\n# Compare the two model summary outputs\nmod_summary\nmod_S_summary\n\n‘sexSum1’ is now the coefficient for sex and represents the change from the intercept value which now lies between the values for being Female and Male. Note how this coefficient is negative.\nThe earlier model had a positive coefficient because the intercept described the reference group of the Girls, who on average begin at a lower well-being level than Boys (refer back to the scatterplot to verify this). Because the sum-coding has moved the intercept to a point that is the center of the difference between Boys and Girls, sexSum1 now describes the distance between the centre and a level of Sex.\nValues for well-being in Girls are thus: \\[ Intercept + sexSum*+1 = 49.74 + (-1.61)*(+1) \\]\nValues for well-being in Boys are thus: \\[Intercept + sexSum*-1 = 49.74 + (-1.61)*(-1)\\]\nwith the Boys being higher in well-being…(remember a negative number multiplied by a negative number produces a positive number and a negative number multiplied by a positive number produces a negative number).\nThe interpretation of both model effects is the same, and if you look at the summary statistics, they are identical. Deviation coding effectively centers your categorical variables and helps with interpretation of interaction terms.\n\n\nStep 8: Checking assumptions\nNow that we’ve fit a model, let’s check whether it meets the assumptions of linearity, normality and homoscedasticity. With regression models, you do this after you’ve actually fit the model.\nLinearity Unlike when we did simple regression we can’t use crPlots() to test for linearity when there is an interaction, but we know from looking at the grouped scatterplot that this assumption has been met.\nNormality Normally we would test for normality with a QQ-plot and a Shapiro-Wilk test. However, because this dataset is so large, the Shapiro-Wilk is not appropriate (if you try to run the test it will produce a warning telling you that the sample size must be between 3 and 5000). This is because with extremely large sample sizes the Shapiro-Wilk test will find that any deviation from normality is significant. Therefore we should judge normality based upon the QQ-plot.\n\nTASK: Create a QQ-plot to check the residuals are normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the qqPlot() function. The residuals are stored in the ‘mod’ object you created earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nqqPlot(mod$residuals)\n\n\n\n\nQUESTION 8a: What do you conclude from the QQ-plot?\n\nHomoscedasticity Here we have the same problem as with testing for normality: with such a large sample the ncvTest() will produce a significant result for any deviation from homoscedasticity. So we need to rely on plots again. To check for homoscedasticity we can use plot() from Base R that will produce a bunch of helpful plots (more information here:.\n\nTASK: Copy the code chunk below to your script and run it.\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))             # 4 charts in 1 panel\nplot(mod)                     # this may take a few seconds to run\n\nThe residuals vs leverage plot shows a flat red line so, whilst it isn’t perfect, we can assume that with such a large sample size regression is still an appropriate analysis.\nMulti-collinearity Finally, lets check for multicollinearity using the vif() function. Essentially, this function estimates how much the variance of a coefficient is “inflated” because of linear dependence with other predictors, i.e., that a predictor isn’t actually adding any unique variance to the model, it’s just really strongly related to other predictors. Thankfully, vif is not affected by large samples like the other tests. There are various rules of thumb, but most converge on a VIF of above 2 to 2.5 for any one predictor being problematic.\n\nTASK: Copy the code chunk below to your script and run it.\n\n\nvif(mod)                      # Check for multi-collinearity\n\n\nQUESTION 8b: Do any of the predictors show evidence of multicollinearity?\n\n\n\nStep 9: Write up\n\nQUESTION 9a: How would you write up the results following APA guidance? You can choose whether you do so for the model using treatment coding or for the model using deviation coding.",

    "text": "Answers\nWhen you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. Remember, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. Actively engaging with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else’s completed code…\n\nYou can download the R-script that includes the relevant code here: 412_wk12_labAct1_withAnswers.R.\n\nLab activity 1: Combining a continuous and a categorical predictor in a regression model\n2a. In which table is the variable corresponding to sex located and what is this variable called? In pinfo; the variable is called sex.\n2b. In what format is the well-being data (long or wide)? On how many participants does it include observations? And on how many items for each participant? The well-being data are in ‘wide’ format. It contains observations on 102580 participants, on 14 items.\n2c. What is the name of the variable that identifies individual participants in this dataset? It is important to work this out as this variable will allow us to link information across the three data files. Serial\n3a. Is the distribution of well-being scores symmetrical, negatively skewed or positively skewed? Negatively skewed\n4a. What are the variables and the levels or conditions within each variable of screen2?\nParticipants plus: Levels: variables = 4: watching tv, playing video games, using computers, using smartphone day = 2 = weekdays, weekends hours = 9 = 0, 0.5, 1 - 7\n4b. What research question does this plot describe? Is it appropriate for the levels within the data? The plot describes how hours of use impact upon well-being? No, it is too broad a research question.\n4c. What research question would fit this visualisation?Is it appropriate for the levels in the data? The hours are now displayed by weekdays and weekends. How do hours of screen time impact on well-being on weekdays and at the weekend? No, it is still too broad.\n4d. What does the facet_wrap() function do? Is this plot appropriate for the levels in the data? The facet_wrap() function has split the types of screen time and shown how hours of use across weekdays and weekends impact upon well-being. This captures the levels of information within the dataset.\n5a. See the script\n6a. Write an interpretation of the above plot in plain English. Something along the lines of: Adolescent girls show lower overall well-being compared to adolescent boys. In addition, the slope for girls appears more negative than that for boys; the one for boys appears relatively flat. This suggests that the negative association between well-being and smartphone use is stronger for girls.\n7a. What is the p-value for the overall model? Is it significant? What does this mean? The p-value for the overall model fit is &lt; 2.2e-16. This significant. It means that together the predictors describe the variance in well-being better than a model without the predictors (the null model). So knowing something about smartphone use and sex of participants will allow us to predict their well-being to a degree.\n7b. To two decimal places, what percentage of the variance in well-being scores does the overall model explain? 9.38%\n7c. Are the main effects of smartphone use and sex significant? Yes.\n7d. Which variable indicates the interaction between smartphone use and sex? The interaction is indicated by the variable hours_per_day:sex.\n7e. And is the interaction significant? Yes.\n7f. What is the most reasonable interpretation of these results? Smartphone use was more negatively associated with well-being for girls than for boys.\n7g. Is being Male better for a person’s well-being in the context of smartphone use than being Female? Yes.\n8a. What do you conclude from the QQ-plot? The residuals are normally distributed.\n8b. Do any of the predictors show evidence of multicollinearity? Yes, Boys and the interaction do. We’ll talk about that more, later in the module.\n\nWrite up\n\nTreatment / dummy coded model Treatment coding was used for categorical predictors with the Girls level acting as the reference group. The results of the regression indicated that the model significantly predicted well-being (F(3, 71029) = 2450.89, p &lt; .001, Adjusted R2 = 0.09), accounting for 9% of the variance.Total hours of smart phone use was a significant negative predictor of well-being scores (β = -0.77, p &lt; .001, as was sex (β = 3.22, p &lt; .001), with girls having lower well-being scores than boys. Importantly, there was a significant interaction between screen time and sex (β = 0.45, p &lt; .001): smartphone use was more negatively associated with well-being for girls than for boys.\nDeviation / sum coded model Deviation coding was used for categorical predictors. The results of the regression indicated that the model significantly predicted well-being (F(3, 71029) = 2450.89, p &lt; .001, Adjusted R2 = 0.09), accounting for 9% of the variance. Total hours of smart phone use was a significant negative predictor of well-being scores (β = -0.55, p &lt; .001, as was sex (β = -1.61, p &lt; .001), with girls having lower well-being scores than boys. Importantly, there was a significant interaction between screen time and sex (β = -0.22, p &lt; .001), indicating that smartphone use was more negatively associated with well-being for girls than for boys.",

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nDefinitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\nSource Code.\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\nBasic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.

Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\nProtecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\nTermination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\nPatents.\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nNo Surrender of Others’ Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\nUse with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n&lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands show w' andshow c’ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html.\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to PSYC412!\nThis module builds on the knowledge and skills acquired in Statistics for Psychologists 1 (PSYC411). You will continue to practise data handling, data processing and data visualisation, using R and R Studio. In addition, you will extend your knowledge of the general linear model and learn how to adapt it when working with different types of data. Of course you’ll also learn how to implement those methods in R and R Studio.\nThis page gives you access to all the materials that you will need. You will have timetabled lab classes during which you are expected to work through a series of exercises to practise that week’s material. Before you come to your lab session, you should watch the lectures for that week, read the relevant book chapter and complete the pre-lab activities.\n\n\nAsking for help\nWe have carefully prepared and refined the lab materials in this course over several years, and we feel that the pace of the materials is just right for our students. Some students will complete them more quickly, and others more slowly - both of these scenarios are absolutely fine. You should work at the pace that suits you best, making sure you understand the materials before you move forward.\nIt is fairly inevitable that you will get stuck on the lab materials in this module at some point. This might be in Week 11, Week 12, or later. When you do, it’s important you reach out for help:\n\nAsk your friends on your table. We’ve designed this teaching space to help collaborative work. You are encouraged to work with other students. Make sure you ask others to explain how they’ve solved an exercise. Make sure you help out others where you can. Always make sure you understand the code and the exercise; don’t simply be satisfied that you’ve got the right answer.\nAsk a GTA or Lecturer. Our teaching staff is there to help you. There are no “stupid questions” in statistics, so just ask the GTA or the lecturer any question about what you’re doing.\nAsk on the Discussion Forum. On the PSYC402 moodle page you will find a Discussion Forum. This is a great way to ask a question outside of the lab sessions. It might seem scary to ask a question in the forum, but please don’t be afraid to do this. If you have a question, you can bet other students also have the same question! So by asking the question on the forum, you help out many more people on the module. A friendly GTA or Lecturer will be along to answer the question as soon as possible (we aim for within 48 hours during the working week).\nAsk on the module Q & A session. Each week we hold a “Q&A” online session where we will try and resolve any general queries and problems. It’s an ideal time to discuss things that students are struggling with or confused about, and can share ideas and answers. You can ask on the discussion forum above and then we might be able to pick up the issues and discuss them, but also you can ask in the session itself.\n\n\n\nCourse Contacts\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\n\nMargriet Groen\nm.groen at lancaster dot ac dot uk\n\n\nRob Davies\nr.davies1 at lancaster dot ac dot uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Pre-lab activities\nAfter having watched the lectures and read the textbook chapters you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\nPre-lab activity 1: Cheatsheets\nIn the first week, we had a look at some of the ‘recipes’ that Posit (the company behind RStudio) provides. If you need a reminder, an overview of all their ‘recipes’ can be found here.\nAnother great resource they provide are the ‘cheatsheets’: one-page overviews of the most important functions in a particular R package/library. There are many and some have been translated into different languages. You can access them online, or print them as a pdf to have on hand.\n\nTASK Explore the cheatsheets linked to below.

Note that when you are not on campus you need to log into the VPN first (look on the portal if you need more information about that).\nCreate a new folder for this week’s work.\nUpload the zip-file to the folder you have created on the RStudio server. Note you can either upload a single file or a zip-file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have difficulty uploading files to the server\n\n\n\nIf you get error messages when attempting to upload a file or a folder with files to the server, you can try the following steps:\n\nClose the R Studio server, close your browser and start afresh.\nOpen the R Studio server in a different browser.\nFollow a work around where you use code to directly download the file to the server. The code to do that will be available at the start of the lab activity where you need that particular file. The code to download the file you need to complete the quiz is below.",

S. and Parker, A. (2005). Beauty in the classroom: instructors’ pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity. Economics of Education Review, 24(4), 369 – 376.\nThe abstract of their paper is below or see here for the paper itself.\nAbstract: Adjusted for many other determinants, beauty affects earnings; but does it lead directly to the differences in productivity that we believe generate earnings differences? We take a large sample of student instructional ratings for a group of university teachers and acquire six independent measures of their beauty, and a number of other descriptors of them and their classes. Instructors who are viewed as better looking receive higher instructional ratings, with the impact of a move from the 10th to the 90th percentile of beauty being substantial. This impact exists within university departments and even within particular courses, and is larger for male than for female instructors. Disentangling whether this outcome represents productivity or discrimination is, as with the issue generally, probably impossible.\nOur research question: Do professors’ beauty score and age predict how students evaluate their teaching?\nTo complete this lab activity, you can use the R-script (412_wk13_labAct1_template.R) that you downloaded as part of the ‘Pre-lab activities’ as a template. Work through the activity below, adding relevant bits of code to your script as you go along.\n\n\nStep 1: Set up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet your working directory\n\n\n\nThe folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class’ contains the data files we’ll need. Make sure you have set your working directory to this folder by right-clicking on it and selecting ‘Set as working directory’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpty the R environment\n\n\n\nBefore you do anything else, when starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one. To do this, you can click on the little broom icon in the top right of the Environment pane, or you can use rm(list=ls()).\n\n\nBefore we can get started we need to tell R which libraries to use. For this analysis we’ll need broom, car, lsr and tidyverse.\n\nTASK: Load the relevant libraries. If you are unsure how to do that, you can look at the ‘Hint’ below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(lsr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you couldn’t upload files to the server, do this:\n\n\n\nIf you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the ‘clipboard’ in the top right corner.\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/mg78/2324_PSYC402/blob/main/data/week13/beauty.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"beauty.csv\")\n\n\nTASK: Finally, read in the data file (beauty.csv), and familiarise yourself with its structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the read_csv() function and the head() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nbeauty &lt;- read_csv(\"beauty.csv\")    \nhead(beauty)\n\n\n\nQUESTION 1: Do you notice anything about the name of one of the variables and the name of the data table?\nThe table contains, amongst other things, the following characteristics of the professors\n\n‘beauty’ - beauty score per professor\n‘eval’ - teaching evaluation score per professor\n‘age’ - age of the professor\n\nQUESTION 2: Go back to the research question (see under ‘Background’ above), which of these three variables is the outcome variable? Which ones are the predictors?\n\n\nStep 2: Descriptive statistics and distributions\n\nTASK: Calculate some descriptive statistics for the variables of interest (eval, beauty and age).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use summarise() to calculate the mean, sd, min and max values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\ndescriptives &lt;- beauty %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_age = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE),\n            min_age = min(age, na.rm = TRUE),\n            max_age = max(age, na.rm = TRUE),\n            mean_eval = mean(eval, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_eval = sd(eval, na.rm = TRUE),\n            min_eval = min(eval, na.rm = TRUE),\n            max_eval = max(eval, na.rm = TRUE),\n            mean_beauty = mean(beauty, na.rm = TRUE),\n            sd_beauty = sd(beauty, na.rm = TRUE),\n            min_beauty = min(beauty, na.rm = TRUE),\n            max_beauty = max(beauty, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\nNow that we have the descriptive statistics, let’s get further information about the distribution of the variables by plotting histograms.\n\nTASK: Visualise the distributions of the variables of interest in histograms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse ggplot() and geom_historgram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = beauty, aes(beauty)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\nggplot(data = beauty, aes(eval)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\nggplot(data = beauty, aes(age)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Center and standardise\nAs mentioned before, it will make it easier to interpret regression models with multiple predictors if we center and standardise our predictors. Before we go any further, we’ll do that.\n\nTASK: Center and standardise the predictor variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nCentering involves subtracting the mean; standardising involves dividing by the standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nbeauty_z &lt;- beauty %&gt;%\n  mutate(age_z = (age - mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(age),\n         beauty_z = (beauty - mean(beauty, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(beauty))\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Scatterplots\nNow let’s have a look at the relationships between variables using scatterplots. To remind yourself of what centering and standardising does, do this for both the raw data and the centered and standardised data.\n\nTASK: Visualise the relationships between the variables of interest in scatterplots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate six different scatterplots using ggplot() with geom_point() and geom_smooth().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(beauty, aes(x = beauty, y = age)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nggplot(beauty, aes(x = beauty, y = eval)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nggplot(beauty, aes(x = age, y = eval)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nggplot(beauty_z, aes(x = beauty_z, y = age_z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nggplot(beauty_z, aes(x = beauty_z, y = eval)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nggplot(beauty_z, aes(x = age_z, y = eval)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\nQUESTION 3: Can you write an interpretation of the above plots in plain English?\nQUESTION 4: What is the difference between the scatterplots plotting the raw data and the ones plotting the centered and standardised data?\nIt is useful to have a quick look at the bivariate correlations between the variables of interest, before you run a regression model. We can easily generate a correlation matrix for these variables.\n\nTASK: Add the code below to your script and check you understand what each line does.\n\n\nbeauty_matrix &lt;- beauty_z %&gt;%\n  select(eval, age_z, beauty_z) %&gt;% # only keep relevant variables\n  as.data.frame() # tell R it is a specific type of data frame (needed for the correlate() function)\n\npairs(beauty_matrix) # make multiple scatterplots in one go\n\nintercor_results &lt;- correlate(x = beauty_matrix, # our data\n                              test = TRUE, # compute p-values\n                              corr.method = \"pearson\", # run a spearman test \n                              p.adjust.method = \"bonferroni\") # use the bonferroni correction\nintercor_results\n\nAfter you’ve run this code, look at the output in the console. It creates three tables, one with correlation coefficients, one with p-values for these coefficients and one with sample sizes.\n\n\nStep 5: The regression model\nWe’ve looked at descriptive statistics and distributions of variables and also at relations between variables. This has given us a good idea of what the data look like. Now we’ll construct the regression model to predict ‘evaluation score’ as a function of ‘age’ and ‘beauty score’. We’ll do this in two stages. First we’ll construct a model without an interaction term. Then we’ll construct a model that includes an interaction term betweeen the two predictor variables. Don’t forget to use the standardised data for all this.\n\nTASK: Construct a regression model without an interaction term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the following formula, lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data); go back to the research question for your outcome and predictor variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nmod &lt;- lm(eval ~ age_z + beauty_z, data = beauty_z)\n\n\n\n\nTASK: Call and save the summary of your model; then have a look at it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the summary() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nmod_int_summary &lt;- summary(mod_int)\nmod_int_summary\n\n\n\nQUESTION 5: Is the overall model significant?\nQUESTION 6: Are the predictors significant? What does this mean?\n\nTASK: Now create a model that includes an interaction term for the two predictors. Again, use the centered and standardised data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the following formula, lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2, data); go back to the research question for your outcome and predictor variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nmod_int &lt;- lm(eval ~ age_z + beauty_z + age_z:beauty_z, data = beauty_z)\nmod_int_summary &lt;- summary(mod_int)\nmod_int_summary\n\n\n\nQUESTION 7: Is the overall model significant?\nQUESTION 8: Have a good look at the coefficients. Can you interpret each one of them in turn and then formulate an overall interpretation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that after centering and standardising, the meaning of 0 has changed for both predictor variables.\n\n\n\nInterpretation of coefficients in a multiple regression can be facilitated by ‘added variable’ plots.\n\nTASK: Use the function avPlots() to create ‘added variable’ plots.\n\nCreating a scatterplot with our outcome variable on the y-axis and the significant predictor on the x-axis and then plotting our third variable (age) using different colours gives some information. Do you see how high age scores (light blue + 2 SD) seem to be more frequent in the bottom left corner?\n\nTASK: Use the code below to create the plot.\n\n\nggplot(data = beauty_z, aes(x = beauty_z, y = eval, colour = age_z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, colour = 'black') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Beauty score\", y = \"Teaching evaluation score\")\n\nBut it might be more useful to plot different regression lines for different values of age. We can do this be transforming age into a categorical variable for plotting purposes. We want to create three categories, based on eye-balling the histogram for age:\n\nyoungest (40 and younger)\naverage (between 41 and 53)\noldest (54 and older).\n\nWe can do this by using the mutate() function, in combination with the cut() function. There is a ‘recipe’ for this on the Posit website:\n\ncut() - group continuous variable into categories - recipe\n\n\nTASK: Read through the recipe mentioned above. Working through the example will be particularly helpful. Write the code to create the categories mentioned above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the relevant bits in the code template below:\n  mutate(NEW VARIABLE = cut(\n    CONTINUOUS VARIABLE,\n    breaks = c(DEFINE BREAK POINTS),\n    labels = c(ADD LABELS FOR BREAK POINTS)\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nbeauty_z_ageCat &lt;- beauty_z %&gt;%\n  mutate(ageCat = cut(\n    age,\n    breaks = c(0, 40, 54, Inf),\n    labels = c(\"youngest\",\"average\",\"oldest\")\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\nNow let’s create a single plot with three different lines, one for each of the age groups created above.\n\nTASK: Copy the code below to your script and make sure you understand what it does.\n\n\nggplot(data = beauty_z_ageCat, aes(x = beauty_z, y = eval, colour = ageCat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Beauty score\", y = \"Teaching evaluation score\")\n\nThe line for the oldest participants seems much steeper than for the other two groups, suggesting that the interaction between age and beauty is mostly driven by older participants who have received more extreme beauty scores.\n\n\nStep 6: Checking assumptions\nNow that we’ve fitted a model, let’s check whether it meets the assumptions of linearity, normality and homoscedasticity.\nLinearity Unlike when we did simple regression we can’t use crPlots() to test for linearity when there is an interaction, but we know from looking at the grouped scatterplot that this assumption has been met.\nNormality Normally we would test for normality with a qq-plot and a Shapiro-Wilk test. However, because this dataset is so large, the Shapiro-Wilk is not appropriate (if you try to run the test it will produce a warning telling you that the sample size must be between 3 and 5000). This is because with extremely large sample sizes the Shapiro-Wilk test will find that any deviation from normality is significant. Therefore we should judge normality based upon the qq-plot.\n\nTASK: Create a qq-plot to check the residuals are normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the qqPlot() function; mind the capital P.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nqqPlot(mod_int$residuals)\n\n\n\nQUESTION 9: What do you conclude from the qq-plot?\nHomoscedasticity Here we have the same problem as with testing for normality: with such a large sample the ncvTest() will produce a significant result for any deviation from homoscedasticity. So we need to rely on plots again.\nTo check for homoscedasticity we can use plot() from Base R that will produce a bunch of helpful plots (more information [here] (https://www.r-bloggers.com/2016/01/how-to-detect-heteroscedasticity-and-rectify-it/)).\n\nTASK: Copy the code below to your script and run it to create the plots\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))                 # 4 charts in 1 panel\nplot(mod_int)                     # this may take a few seconds to run\n\nQUESTION 10: What do you conclude from the residuals vs leverage plot?\nMulti-collinearity Now let’s check for multi-collinearity using the vif() function. Essentially, this function estimates how much the variance of a coefficient is “inflated” because of linear dependence with other predictors, i.e., that a predictor isn’t actually adding any unique variance to the model, it’s just really strongly related to other predictors. Thankfully, the vif() function is not affected by large samples like the other tests. There are various rules of thumb, but most converge on a VIF of above 2 - 2.5 for any one predictor being problematic.\n\nTASK: Use the vif() function to test for multi-collinearity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nvif(mod_int)   \n\n\n\nQUESTION 11: Do any of the predictors show evidence of multi-collinearity?\nFinally, we need to write up the results.\nQUESTION 12: Can you write up the results of the regression analysis following APA guidelines?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to mention and interpret the interaction effect.",

    "text": "Answers\nWhen you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. Remember, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. Actively engaging with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else’s completed code…\n\nYou can download the R-script that includes the relevant code here: 412_wk13_labAct1_withAnswers.R.\n\nDo you notice anything about the name of one of the variables and the name of the data table? Both the data table and one of the variables are called ‘beauty’. The code works, but it is not good practice. It would be better to have different names for the data table and the variable, to you or R getting confused.\nGo back to the research question (see under ‘Background’ above), which of these three variables is the outcome variable? Which ones are the predictors? The research question is ‘Do professors’ beauty score and age predict how students evaluate their teaching?’ From this we can deduct that the outcome variable is teaching evaluation score and that the predictors are age and beauty score.\nCan you write an interpretation of the above plots in plain English? A moderate negative association seems present between beauty score and age: with increasing age, beauty score decreases. A moderate positive association seems present between beauty score and teaching evaluation: professors with higher beauty scores also receive higher teaching evaluations. Not much of a association seems present between age and teaching evaluation (the line is pretty horizontal).\nWhat is the difference between the scatterplots plotting the raw data and the ones plotting the centered and standardised data? The units of the x-axis have changed from years (for age) and scores (for beauty) to standard units, with zero in the middle.\nIs the overall model significant? Yes, F(2, 460) = 8.53, p = .0002\nAre the predictors significant? What does this mean? The beauty score significantly predicts teaching evaluation score, but age does not. Professors with higher beauty scores, received better teaching evaluations.\nIs the overall model significant? Yes, F(3, 459) = 9.32, p = 5.451e-06\nHave a good look at the coefficients. Can you interpret each one of them in turn and then formulate an overall interpretation? HINT: Remember that after centering and standardising, the meaning of 0 has changed for both predictor variables. The intercept is predicted teaching evaluation score for a professor with average age and average beauty score. The slope of ‘age’ is positive; this means that for higher age, teaching evaluation scores were better. However the coefficient is not significant, therefore has little predictive power.The slope of ‘beauty’ is positive; this means that with higher beauty score, professors receive higher teaching evaluations. This predictor is significant. The slope for the interaction is also positive. This can be read as follows: When age and beauty both increase, teaching evaluation score also increases. The interaction is significant.\nWhat do you conclude from the qq-plot? The residuals are mostly normally distributed. At the top right (quantile + 3), there are some values that don’t quite look normally distributed, this is probably due to fewer data points being available in the highest age bracket. Have a look at a histogram for age. There are a few individuals well above the retirement age, but clearly a lot fewer than in younger age brackets. This basically means that the model does not do a particularly good job for predicting evaluation score at high values of age. As retirement age is quite a natural point to limit the data, you could run the model again, only including people below retirement age, this should give you better behaving residuals. Ideally, you’d pre-register a decision such as this. If you didn’t do this prior to data collection, you could still limit the age range included in the final model, but you would need to be transparent in your reporting.\nWhat do you conclude from the residuals vs leverage plot? The residuals vs leverage plot shows a flat red line so, whilst it isn’t perfect, we can assume that with regression is still an appropriate analysis.\nDo any of the predictors show evidence of multi-collinearity? No\nCan you write up the results of the regression analysis following APA guidelines? The results of the regression indicated that the model significantly predicted teaching evaluation scores (F(3, 459) = 9.316, p &lt; .001, adjusted R^2 = 0.05), accounting for 5% of the variance. A professor’s beauty score was a significant positive predictor of teaching evaluation score (\\(\\beta\\) = 0.12, p &lt; .001). This effect was moderated by a significant positive interaction between beauty score and age (\\(\\beta\\) = 0.08, p &lt; .001), suggesting that when age and beauty score both increased, teaching evaluation score also increased.",

Another common type of data is count data, where values are also discrete. Often with count data, the number of opportunities for something to occur is not well-defined. For instance, the number of speech error in a corpus, the number of turn shifts between speakers in a conversation or the number of visits to the doctor.

    "text": "Pre-lab activities\nAfter having watched the lectures and read the textbook chapters you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.\n\nPre-lab activity 1: Getting ready\n\nGet your files ready\nDownload the 412_week14_forStudents.zip file and upload it into a new folder in RStudio Server.\n\n\nRemind yourself of how to access and work with the RStudio Server.\n\nSign in to the RStudio Server. Note that when you are not on campus you need to log into the VPN first (look on the portal if you need more information about that).\nCreate a new folder for this week’s work.\nUpload the zip-file to the folder you have created on the RStudio server. Note you can either upload a single file or a zip-file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have difficulty uploading files to the server\n\n\n\nIf you get error messages when attempting to upload a file or a folder with files to the server, you can try the following steps:\n\nClose the R Studio server, close your browser and start afresh.\nOpen the R Studio server in a different browser.\nFollow a work around where you use code to directly download the file to the server. The code to do that will be available at the start of the lab activity where you need that particular file. The code to download the file you need to complete the quiz is below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-lab activity 2: Rainy days\nTry running the code mentioned in the online textbook by Barr. If you find it easier, use the rainy_days.R script (in the ‘412_week14_forStudents folder you were asked to download in ’Pre-lab activity 1’). It illustrates the point that for discrete data, the variance is often not independent from the mean. In addition, it introduces some very useful R functions: What do the rep() function, the c() function and the facet_wrap() function do? Remember, you can type ?function name() (e.g., ?rep()) in the Console to get more information about a function.

In the pre-lab activity, we explored the dataset and fitted a first logistic regression model assessing whether participants’ perception of a gesture (expressed as a categorical decision between a ‘shape’ vs. a ‘height’ interpretation of the gesture) was affected by the extent of ‘pinkie curl’. In this lab activity, we’ll be building on that analysis by: 1) Repeating the analysis with a centered pinkie curl variable, and 2) by adding a second predictor: index_curve.\nOur research question: Is gesture perception associated with different aspects of hand shape?\n\n\nStep 1: Set up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet your working directory\n\n\n\nThe folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 1: Getting ready for the lab class’ contains the data files we’ll need. Make sure you have set your working directory to this folder by right-clicking on it and selecting ‘Set as working directory’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpty the R environment\n\n\n\nBefore you do anything else, when starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one. To do this, you can click on the little broom icon in the top right of the Environment pane, or you can use rm(list=ls()).\n\n\nBefore we can get started we need to tell R which libraries to use. For this analysis we’ll need broom and tidyverse.\n\nTASK: Load the relevant libraries. If you are unsure how to do that, you can look at the ‘Hint’ below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the ‘Code’ section below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the library() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you couldn’t upload files to the server, do this:\n\n\n\nIf you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the ‘clipboard’ in the top right corner.\n\n\n\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/mg78/2324_PSYC402/blob/main/data/week14/hassemer_winter_2016_gesture.csv?raw=true\", destfile = \"hassemer_winter_2016_gesture.csv\")\n\n\nTASK: Finally, read in the data file (hassemer_winter_2016_gesture.csv), and familiarise yourself with its structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the read_csv() function and the head() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code to do this is below.\nges &lt;- read_csv(\"hassemer_winter_2016_gesture.csv\")\nhead(ges)\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Descriptive statistics and distributions\nAs part of the pre-lab activities, you’ve already familiarised yourself with the dataset by looking at:\n\nhow participants were distributed across the pinkie curl conditions;\nwhich response option was chosen more frequently in total and across pinkie curl conditions;\nproportions of response options across pinkie curl conditions\n\n\nTASK: Please remind yourself of these stages if necessary by revisiting the chaper12_6.R script.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Data wrangling\nFor logistic regression, the outcome variable needs to either be coded as 0 or 1, or it needs to be coded as a factor.\n\nTASK: Write the code to convert the outcome variable to a factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse mutate() and factor().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nges &lt;- mutate(ges, choice = factor(choice))\n\n\n\nAs with linear regression, centering your predictor makes it easier to interpret the output of a logistic regression.\n\nTASK: Write the code to center the pinkie curl predictor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nCentering involves subtracting the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nges &lt;- mutate(ges,\n    pinkie_c = pinkie_curl - mean(pinkie_curl))\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Fit the regression model with the centered variable\nNow let’s re-fit choice (height vs. shape) as a function of pinkie curl, but using the centered variable.\n\nTASK: Write the code to fit the model and check the coefficients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the glm() function and remember you need to specify the ‘family’ argument. To check the coefficients, you can use the tidy() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nges_mdl_c &lt;- glm(choice ~ pinkie_c,\n               data = ges, family = 'binomial')\ntidy(ges_mdl_c)\n\n\n\nQUESTION 1: How does the coefficient table differ from the model fitted earlier where you used the pinkie curl predictor before you centered it?\nQUESTION 2: How should you now (using the model with the centered pinkie curl predictor) interpret the intercept?\nThe average pinkie curl is step 5 on the 9 step continuum. From our previous analysis (pre-lab activity), we know that the predicted log odds of ‘shape’ at that step was 0.38 and the probability was 0.59. So if we extract the intercept from the coefficient table of the model using the centered predictor, we should get those values. Use the code below to do so and compare the values to the ones from the pre-lab activity.\n\n# Extracting the estimate for the intercept and storing it in an object called intercept:\nintercept_logOdds &lt;- tidy(ges_mdl_c)$estimate[1]\n\n# Getting the predicted probability by applying the logistic:\nintercept_prob &lt;- plogis(intercept_logOdds)\n\nintercept_logOdds\nintercept_prob\n\nThe values are roughly the same!\n\n\nStep 6: Incorporating a second predictor\nIn addition to the ‘pinkie curl’, the extent to which the index finger is curved may also affect gesture perception. This is quantified in the ‘index_curve’ variable. Before we fit the model, we need to center both predictors.\n\nTASK: Write the code to center the second predictor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nCentering involves subtracting the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nges &lt;- mutate(ges,\n              index_c = index_curve - mean(index_curve))\n\n\n\n\nTASK: Write the code to fit model with both pinkie curl and index curve and check the coefficients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the glm() function and remember you need to specify the ‘family’ argument. To check the coefficients, you can use the tidy() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nboth_mdl &lt;- glm(choice ~ pinkie_c + index_c,\n    data = ges, family = 'binomial')\ntidy(both_mdl)\n\n\n\nQUESTION 3: How does the index_curve predictor affect the proportion of shape responses?\nWe can see this more easily if we compare the descriptive proportions:\n\nindex_tab &lt;- with(ges, table(index_curve, choice))\nindex_tab\n\nprop.table(index_tab, 1)\n\nThe “1” in here stands for row-wise proportions.”2” would compute column-wise proportions.",

    "section": "The key ideas",
    "text": "The key ideas\nThere are two ideas motivating our approach. It will be helpful to you if I sketch them out early, here. We can demonstrate the usefulness of these ideas as we progress through our work.\nThe first key idea is expressed clearly in sociological discussions of science. This is that there is a difference between science “…being done, science in the making, and science already done, a finished product …” [Bourdieu (2004); p.2]. The awareness we want to develop is that there are two things: there is the story that may be presented in a textbook or in a lecture about scientific work or scientific claims; and there is the work we do in practice, as we develop graduate skills, and as we exercise those skills professionally in the workplace.\nThe second key idea connects to the first. This idea is that reported analyses are not necessary or sufficient to the data or the question. What does this mean? It means that the same data can reasonably be analysed in different ways. There is no necessary way to analyse some data though there may be conventions or normal practices (Kuhn, 1970). It means that it is unlikely that any one analysis will do all the work that could be done (a sufficiency) to get you from your data to useful or reasonable answers to your questions.\nThese ideas may be unsettling but they are realistic. Stating them will better prepare you for professional work. In the workplace, the accuracy of these ideas will emerge when you see how a team in any sector (health, marketing …) gets from its data to its product. If we talk about the ideas now, we can get you ready for dealing with the practical and the ethical concerns you will confront when that happens.\nWe will begin by discussing psychological research, and research about psychological research, to answer the question: Why: what is the motivation for the assignment?",

    "text": "Why: what is the motivation for the assignment?\n\nThe wider context: crisis and revolution\nWe are here because we are interested in humans and human behaviour, and because we are interested in scientific methods of making sense of these things. Some of us are aware that science (including psychological science) has undergone a rolling series of crises: the replicability or replication crisis (Pashler & Harris, 2012; Pashler & Wagenmakers, 2012); the statistical crisis (A. Gelman & Loken, 2014b); and the generalizability crisis (Yarkoni, 2022). And that science is undergoing a response to these crises, evidenced in the advocacy of pre-registration (Nosek et al., 2018, 2019), and of registered reports (Nosek & Lakens, 2014), the use of open science badges (e.g., for the journal Psychological Science), the completion of large-scale replication studies (Aarts et al., 2015), and the identification of open science principles (Munafò et al., 2017). We may usefully refer, collectively, to the crises and the responses, as the credibility revolution (Vazire, 2018)\nWe could teach a course on this (in Lancaster, we do) but, here, I invite you to follow the references if you are interested. Before going on, I want to call your attention to the fact that important elements of the hard work in trying to make science work better has been led by PhD students and by junior researchers (e.g., Herndon et al., 2014). Graduate students may, at first, assume that the fact that a research article has been published in a journal means the findings that are reported must be true. Most of the time, some educated skepticism is more appropriate. An important driver of the realization that there are problems evident in the literature, and that there are changes we can make to improve practice, comes from independent post-publication review work exposing the problems in published work (see, e.g., this account by Andrew Gelman)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nAllow yourself to feel skeptical about the reports you read then work with the motivation this feeling provides.\n\n\n\nIn brief, then, most practicing scientists now understand or should understand that many of the claims we encounter in the published scientific literature are unlikely to be supported by the evidence (Ioannidis, 2005), whether we are looking at the evidence of the results in the reports themselves, or evidence in later attempts to find the same results (e.g., Aarts et al., 2015). We suspect that this may result from a number of causes. We understand that researchers may engage in questionable research practices (John et al., 2012). We understand that researchers may exploit the potential for flexibility in doing and reporting analyses (Simmons et al., 2011a). We understand that there are problems in how psychologists use or talk about the measurement of psychological constructs (Flake & Fried, 2020). We understand that there are problems in how psychologists sample people for their studies, both in where we recruit (Bornstein et al., 2013; Henrich et al., 2010; Wild et al., 2022), and in how many we recruit (Button et al., 2013; Cohen, 1962; Sedlmeier & Gigerenzer, 1989; Vankov et al., 2014). We understand that there are problems in how psychologists specify or think about their hypotheses or predictions (Meehl, 1967; Scheel, 2022). And we understand that there are problems in how scientists do, or rather do not, comply with good practice recommendations designed to fix these problems (discussed further in the following).\nThis discussion could (again) be unsettling. This list of problems could make you angry or sad. I, like others, think it is exciting. It is exciting because these problems have probably existed for a long time (e.g., Cohen, 1962; Meehl, 1967) but now, having identified the problems, we can hope to do something about it. It is exciting because if you care about people, the study of people, or the applications in clinical, education and other domains of the results of the study of people, then you might hope to see better, more useful, science in the future (Vazire, 2018).\nAs someone who teaches graduate and undergraduate students, I want to help you to be the change you want to see in the world 1. We cannot solve every problem but we can try to do better those things that are within our reach. I am going to end this introduction with a brief discussion of some ideas we can use to guide our better practices.\n\n\nThe specific context: what we need to look at, conceptually and practically\nIn this course, for this assignment, we are going to focus on:\n\nmultiverse analyses\nkinds of reproducibility\nthe current state of the match between open science ideas and practices\n\nIn the classes on the linear model, we will discuss:\n\nthe links between theory, prediction and analysis\npsychological measurement\nsamples\nvariation in results\n\n\n\nMultiverse analyses: multi- what?\n\nA first useful metaphor: the pipeline\nI am going to link this discussion to a metaphor (see Figure Figure 1) or a description you will find useful: the data analysis pipeline or workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\ncluster_R\n\n\n\n\nnd_1\n\nGet raw data\n\n\n\nnd_2\n\nTidy data\n\n\n\nnd_1-&gt;nd_2\n\n\n\n\n\nnd_3_l\n\nVisualize\n\n\n\nnd_2-&gt;nd_3_l\n\n\n\n\n\nnd_3\n\nanalyse\n\n\n\nnd_2-&gt;nd_3\n\n\n\n\n\nnd_3_r\n\nExplore\n\n\n\nnd_2-&gt;nd_3_r\n\n\n\n\n\nnd_3_a\n\nAssumptions\n\n\n\nnd_3_a-&gt;nd_3_l\n\n\n\n\n\nnd_3_a-&gt;nd_3\n\n\n\n\n\nnd_3_a-&gt;nd_3_r\n\n\n\n\n\nnd_3_l-&gt;nd_3\n\n\n\n\nnd_4\n\nPresent\n\n\n\nnd_3_l-&gt;nd_4\n\n\n\n\n\nnd_3-&gt;nd_4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The data analysis pipeline or workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nThis metaphor or way of thinking is very common (take a look at the diagram in Wickham and Grolemund’s 2017 book “R for Data Science) and you may see the words “data pipeline” used in job descriptions, or you may benefit from saying, in a job application, something like: I am skilled in designing and implementing each stage of the quantitative data analysis pipeline, from data tidying to results presentation. I say this because scientists I have mentored got their jobs because they can do these things – and successfully explained that they can do these things – in sectors like educational testing, behavioural analysis, or public policy research.\nThe reason this metaphor is useful is that it helps us to organize our thinking, and to manage what we do when we do data analysis, we:\n\nget some data;\nprocess or tidy the data;\nexplore, visualize, and analyse the data;\npresent or report our findings.\n\nWe introduce the idea that your analysis work will flow through the stages of a pipeline from getting the data to presenting your findings because, next, we will examine how pipelines can multiply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nAs you practice your data analysis work, try to identify the elements and the order of your work, as the parts of a workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\nA second useful metaphor: the garden of forking paths\nWhat researchers have come to realize: because we started looking … The open secret that has been well kept (Bourdieu, 2004): because everybody who does science knows about it, yet we may not teach it; and because we do not write textbooks revealing it … Is that at each stage in the analysis workflow, we can and do make choices where multiple alternative choices are possible. A. Gelman & Loken (2014a) capture this insight as the “garden of forking paths”2 (see Figure 2).\nThe general idea is that it is possible to have multiple potential different paths from the data to the results. The results will vary, depending on the path we take. In an analysis, we could take multiple different paths simply because at point A we decide to do B1, B2 or B3, maybe we choose B1, and then at point B1, we may decide to do C1, C2 or C3. Here, maybe we have our raw data at point A. Maybe we could do one of two different things when we tidy the data: action B1 or B2. Then, when we have our tidy data, maybe we can choose to do our analysis in one of six ways. Where we are at each step depends on the choices we made at the previous steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nA\n\nA\n\n\n\nB1\n\nB1\n\n\n\nA-&gt;B1\n\n\n\n\n\nB2\n\nB2\n\n\n\nA-&gt;B2\n\n\n\n\n\nC1\n\nC1\n\n\n\nB1-&gt;C1\n\n\n\n\n\nC2\n\nC2\n\n\n\nB1-&gt;C2\n\n\n\n\n\nC3\n\nC3\n\n\n\nB1-&gt;C3\n\n\n\n\n\nC4\n\nC4\n\n\n\nB2-&gt;C4\n\n\n\n\n\nC5\n\nC5\n\n\n\nB2-&gt;C5\n\n\n\n\n\nC6\n\nC6\n\n\n\nB2-&gt;C6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Forking paths in data analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, it may appear to us that we took one path or that only one path was possible. When we report our analysis, in a dissertation or in a published journal article, we may report the analysis as if only one analysis path had been considered. But, critically, our findings may depend on the choices we made and this variation in results may be hidden from view.\nI am talking about forking paths because the multiplicity of paths has consequences, and we discuss these next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nIt is about here, I hope, that you can start to see why it would makes sense to access data from a published study and to examine if you can get the same results as the study authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiverse analyses\nI am going to discuss, now, what are commonly called multiverse analyses. Psychologists use this term, having been introduced to it in an influential paper by Steegen et al. (2016a), but it comes from theoretical physics (take a look at wikipedia).\nI explain this because I do not want you to worry. The ideas themselves are within your grasp whatever your background in psychology or elsewhere. It is the implications for our data analysis practices that are challenging. They are challenging because what we discuss should increase your skepticism about the results you encounter in published papers. And they are challenging because they reveal your freedom to question whether published authors could have done their analysis in a different way.\nWe are going to look at:\n\ndata-set construction\nanalysis choices\n\n\nThe link between the credibility revolution and the multiverse\nIn first discussing the wider context (of crisis and revolution), then discussing the specific context (of multiverses and, in the following, of reproducibility), I should be clear about the link between the two things. The finding that some results may not be supported by the evidence is probably due to a mix of causes. But one of those causes will be the combination of uncertainty over data processing or the uncertainty over analysis methods revealed in multiverse analyses, as we see next, combined with the limitations of data and code sharing, and the incompleteness of results reporting (as we see later).\n\n\nThe data multiverse\nWhen you collect or access data for a research study, the complete raw data-set you receive is almost never the complete data-set you analyse or whose analysis you report. This is not a story about deliberately cheating. It is a story about the normal practice of science (Kuhn, 1970).\nPicture some common scenarios. You did a survey, you got responses from a 100 participants on 10 questions, and you asked people to report their education, ethnicity and gender. You did an experimental study, you tested two groups of 50 people each in 100 trials (imagine a common task like the Stroop test), and you observed the accuracy and the timing of their responses. You tested 100 children, 20 children in each of five different schools, on a range of educational ability measures.\nIn these scenarios, the psychologist or the analyst of behavioural data must process their data. In doing so, you will ask yourself a series of questions like:\n\nhow do we code for gender, ethnicity, education?\nwhat do we about reaction times that are very short, e.g., \\(RT &lt; 200ms\\) or very long, e.g., \\(RT &gt; 1500ms\\))?\nif we present multiple questions measuring broadly the same thing (e.g. how confident are you that you understand what you have read? how easy did you find what you read?) how do we summarize the scores on those questions? do we combine scores?\nwhat do we do about people who may not appear to have understood the task instructions?\n\nTypically, the answers to these questions will be given to you by your supervisor, a colleague or a textbook example. For example, we might say:\n\n“We excluded all reaction times greater than 1500ms before analysis.”\n\nTypically, the explanation for these answers are rarely explained. We might say:\n\n“Consistent with common practice in this field, we excluded all reaction times greater than 1500ms before analysis.”\n\nBut the reader of a journal article typically will not see an explanation for why, as in the example, we exclude reaction times greater than 1500ms and not 2000ms or 3000ms, etc. We typically do not see an explanation for why we exclude all reaction times greater than 1500ms but other researchers exclude all reaction times greater than 2000ms. (I do not pick this example at random: there are serious concerns about the impact on analyses of exclusions like this (Ulrich & Miller, 1994).)\nWhat Steegen et al. (2016a) showed is that a data-set can be processed for analysis in multiple different ways, with a number of reasonable alternate choices that can be applied, for each choice point: construction choices about classifying people or about excluding participants given their responses. If a different data-set is constructed for each combination of alternatives then many different data-sets can be produced, all starting from the same raw data. (For their example study, Steegen et al. (2016a) found they could construct 120 or 210 different data-sets, based on the choice combinations.) Critically, for us, Steegen et al. (2016a) showed that if we apply the same analysis method to the different data-sets then our results will vary.\nLet me spell this out, bit by bit:\n\nwe approach our study with the same research question, and the same verbal prediction;\nwe begin with the exact same data;\nwe then construct different data-sets depending on different but equally reasonable processing choices;\nwe then apply the same analysis analysis, to test the same prediction, using each different data-set;\nwe will see different results for the analyses of the different data-sets.\n\nAlternate constructions of the same data may cause variation in the results of statistical tests. Some kinds of data processing choices may be more influential on results than others. It seems unlikely that we can identify, in advance, which choices matter more.\nSteegen et al. (2016a) suggest that we can deflate (shrink) the multiverse in different ways. I want to state their suggestions, here, because we will come back to these ideas in the classes on the linear model.\n\nDevelop better theories and improved measurement of the constructs of interest.\nDevelop more complete and precise theory for why some processing options are better than others.\n\nBut you will be asking yourself: What do I need to think about, for the research report assignment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nWhen you read a psychological research report, identify where the researchers talk about how they process their data: classification, coding, exclusion, transformation, etc.\nIf you can access the raw data, ask yourself: could different choices change the results of the same analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis multiverses\nEven if we begin with the same research question and, critically, the same data-set, the results of a series of studies show that different researchers will often (reasonably) make different choices about the analysis they do to answer the research question. We often call these studies (analysis or model) multiverse studies. In these studies, we see variation in analysis and this variation is also associated with variation in results.\nAn influential example, in psychology, is reported by Silberzahn and colleagues (Silberzahn et al., 2017; Silberzahn & Uhlmann, 2015) who asked 29 teams of researchers to answer the same question (“Are (soccer) referees more likely to give red cards to players with dark skin than to players with light skin?”) with the same data-set (data about referee decisions in football league games). The teams made their own decisions about how to answer the question in doing the analysis. The teams shared their plans, and commented on each others’ ideas. The discussion did not lead to a consensus about what analysis approach is best. In the end, the different teams did different analyses and, critically, the different analyses had different results. The results varied in whether the test of the effect of players skin colour (on whether red cards were given) was significant or not, and on the strength of the estimated association between the darkness of skin colour (lighter to darker) and the chances (low to high) of getting a red card.\nThere have now been a series of multiverse or multi-analyst studies which demonstrate that, under certain conditions, different researchers may adopt different analysis approaches – which will have different results – in answering the same research question with the same data. This demonstration has been repeated in studies in health, medicine, psychology, neuoscience, and sociology, among other research fields (e.g., Parsons (n.d.); Breznau et al. (2022); Klau et al. (n.d.); Klau et al. (2021); Wessel et al. (2020); Poline et al. (2006); Maier-Hein et al. (2017); Starns et al. (2019); Fillard et al. (2011); Dutilh et al. (2019); Salganik et al. (2020); Bastiaansen et al. (2020); Botvinik-Nezer et al. (2020); Schweinsberg et al. (2021); Patel et al. (2015); see, for reviews, and some helpful guidance, Aczel et al. (2021); Del Giudice & Gangestad (2021); Hoffmann et al. (n.d.); Wagenmakers et al. (2022)).\nIn these studies, we typically see variation in how psychological constructs are operationalized (e.g., how do we measure or code for social status?), how data are processed or data-sets constructed (as in Steegen et al. (2016b)), plus variation in what statistical techniques are used, and in how those techniques are used. This variation can be understood to reflect kinds of uncertainty (Klau et al., n.d.; Klau et al., 2021): uncertainty about how to process data, and uncertainty about the model or methods we should use to test or estimate effects. Further research makes it clear that we should be aware, if we are not already, of the variation in results that can be expected because different researchers may choose to design studies, and construct stimulus materials, in different ways given the same research hypothesis information (Landy et al., 2020).\nBut you will be asking yourself: What do I need to think about, for the research report assignment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nWhen you read a psychological research report, identify where the researchers talk about how they analyse their data: the hypothesis or prediction they test; the method; their assumptions; the variables they include; the checks or the alternate analyses they did or did not do.\nIf you can access the data and analysis code, ask yourself: could different methods change the results of the same analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we conclude – the story so far?\nThis is a good place to look at what we have discussed, and present an evaluation of the story so far.\nThis is not a story where everybody or nobody is right or where everything or nothing is true 3. Instead, we can be guided by the advice (Meehl, 1967; Scheel, 2022; Steegen et al., 2016a) that we should:\n\nseek better and more complete theorizing about the constructs of interest and how we measure them, and\nseek more complete and more precise theory so that some options are theoretically superior than others, and should be preferred, when constructing data-sets or specifying analysis methods.\n\nNot all research questions and not all hypothesis information will allow an equally wide variety of potential reasonable approaches to the analysis. As Paul Meehl argued a long time ago (Meehl, 1967, 1978), and researchers like Anne Scheel (Scheel et al., 2021; Scheel, 2022) argued more recently, the complexity of the thing we study – people, and what they do – and the still early development of our understanding of this thing, mean that what we want but what we do not see, in psychology, are scientifically productive tests of falsifiable theories. (See, consistent with this perspective, discussions by Auspurg & Brüderl (2021) and by Del Giudice & Gangestad (2021) about the range of analysis possibilities that may or may not be allowed, in multiverse analyses, by more or less clear research questions or well-developed causal theories.) Our concern should not so much be with being able to do statistical analysis, or with finding significant or not significant results. It would be more useful to do analyses to test concrete, inflexible, precise predictions that can be wrong.\nNor is this a story, I think, about the potential for cheating. While we may refer to subjective choices or to researcher flexibility, the differences that we see do not resemble the researcher degrees of freedom (Simmons et al., 2011b) some may exploit, consciously or unconsciously, to change results to suit their aims. Instead, the multiverse results show us the impact of the reasonable differences in approach that different researchers may sensibly choose to take when they try to answer a research question with data.\nNot all alternates, at a given point of choosing, in the data analysis workflow, will have equal impact. Work by Young (Young, 2018; Young & Holsteen, 2017) indicates that if we deliberately examine the impact of method or model uncertainty, over different sets of possible choices — about what variables or what observations we include in an analysis, for example — we may find that some results are robust to an array of different options, while other results are highly susceptible to different choices. This work suggests another way in which uncertainty about methods or variation in results can be turned into progress in understanding the phenomena that interest us: through systematic, informed, interrogation of the ways that results can vary.\nIn general, in science, the acceptance of research findings must always be negotiated (Bourdieu, 2004). Here, we see that the grounds of negotiation should often include an analysis of the impact on the value of evidence of the different analysis approaches that researchers can or do apply to the data that underlie that evidence.\nBut you will be asking yourself: what do I need to think about, for the assignment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nThe results of multiverse analyses show us that if we see one analysis reported in a paper, or one workflow, that does not mean that only one analysis can reasonably be applied.\nIf you read the methods or results section of a paper, you should reflect: what other analysis methods could be used here? How could variation in analysis method — in what or how you do the analysis — influence the results?\n\n\n\nMaking you aware of the potential for analysis choices is useful because developing researchers, including graduate students, are often not aware of the room for choice in the data analysis workflow. Developing researchers — you — may be instructed that “this is how we do things” or “you should follow what researchers did previously”. Following convention is not necessarily a bad thing: it is a feature of the normal practice of science (Kuhn, 1970). However, you can now see, perhaps, that there likely will be alternative ways to process or to analyse data than the approach a supervisor, lab or field normally adopts.\nThis understanding or awareness has three implications for practice, it means:\n\nWhen we talk about the analysis we do, we should explain our choices.\nWe should check, or enable others to check, what impact making different choices would have on our results.\nMost importantly: we can allow ourselves the freedom to critically evaluate the choices researchers make, even the choices researchers make in published articles.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the multiverse to kinds of reproducibility\nMultiverse analyses and post-publication analyses, in general, show that we can and should question or critically evaluate the analyses we encounter in the literature. This work can usefully detect problems in original published analyses (e.g., A. Gelman & Weakliem, 2009; Herndon et al., 2014; Wagenmakers et al., 2011). It can demonstrate where original published claims are or are not robust to variation of analysis method or approach.\nGiven these lessons, and the implications we have identified, we should expect or hope to see open science practices (Munafò et al., 2017; Nosek et al., 2022):\n\nshare data and code;\npublish research reports in ways that enable others to check or query analyses.\n\nAs we discuss, following, these practices are now common but the quality of practice can sometimes be questioned. This matters for you because it makes it more challenging – in specific identifiable locations – to locate, access, analyse and report previously collected data.\nThe discussion of current practices identifies where or how the assignment may be more challenging, but also identifies some of the exact places where the assignment provides a real opportunity to do original research work.\nFirst, I am going to introduce some ideas that will help you to think about what you are doing when you do this work. We focus on the concept of reproducibility.\nGilmore et al. (2017; following Goodman et al., 2016) present three kinds of reproducibility:\n\nmethods reproducibility\nresults reproducibility\ninferential reproducibility\n\nIn looking at reproducibility, here, we are considering how much, or in what ways, the results or the claims that are made in a published study can be found or repeated by someone else.\n\nMethods reproducibility\nAs Gilmore et al. (2017) discuss, methods reproducibility means that another researcher should be able to get the same results if they use the same tools and analysis methods to analyse the same data-set [some researchers also refer to analytic reproducibility or computational reproducibility; see, e.g., Crüwell et al. (n.d.); Hardwicke et al. (2018); Hardwicke et al. (n.d.); Laurinavichyute et al. (2022); Minocher et al. (n.d.)].\nIn neuroimaging, the multiplicity of possible implementations of the data analysis pipeline (Carp, 2012a), and the fact that important elements or information about the pipeline deployed by researchers may be missing from published reports (Carp, 2012b), can make it challenging to identify how results can be reproduced.\nIn psychological science, in evaluating reports of results from analyses of behavioural data collected through survey or experimental work, in principle, we should expect to be able to access the data collected by the study authors, follow the description of their analysis method, and reproduce the results they report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nFor an assignment in which we ask students to locate, access, analyse and report previously collected data, we are directly concerned with methods reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nResults reproducibility\nResults reproducibility means that if another researcher completes a new study with new data they are able to get the same results as the results reported following an original study: this often referred to as replication. The replication studies that have been reported (e.g., Aarts et al., 2015), and continue to be reported (see, for example, the studies discussed by Nosek et al. (2022)), in the last several years, present attempts to examine the results reproducibility of published findings.\nIn the classes on the linear model, we will examine if similar or different results are observed in a series of studies using the same procedure and the same materials. We shall discuss, in those classes, in more depth, what results reproducibility (or study replication) can or cannot tell us about the behaviours that interest us.\n\n\nInferential reproducibility\nInferential reproducibility means that if a researcher repeats a study (aiming for results reproducibility) or re-analyses an original data-set (aiming for methods reproducibility) then they can come to the same or similar conclusions as the authors of the report of an original study.\nHow is inferential reproducibility not methods or results reproducibility? Goodman et al. (2016) explain that researchers can make the same conclusions from different sets of results and can reach different conclusions from the same set of results.\nHow is it possible to reach different conclusions from the same results? We can imagine two scenarios.\nFirst, we have to think about the wider research field, the research context, within which we consider a set of results. It may be that two different researchers will come to look at the same results with different expectations about what the results could tell us (in Bayesian terms, with different prior expectations). Given different expectations, it is easy to imagine different researchers looking at the same results and, for example, one researcher being more skeptical than another about what conclusion can be taken from those results. (In the class on graduate writing skills, I discuss in some depth the importance of reviewing a research literature in order to get an understanding of the assumptions, conventions or expectations that may be shared by the researchers working in the field.)\nSecond, imagine two different researchers looking at the same results — picture the original authors of a published study, and someone doing a post-publication re-analysis of their data — you can expect that the re-analysis or the reproducibility analysis could identify reasons to value the evidence differently, or to reach more skeptical conclusions, through critical evaluation of:\n\ndata processing choices;\nthe choice of the method used to do analysis;\nchoices in how the analysis method is used.\n\n… where that critical evaluation involves an analysis of the choices the original researchers made, perhaps involving an analysis of other choices they could have made, perhaps reflecting on how effectively the analyses address a given research question or test a given prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nWe can think about the work we do, when we analyse previously reported data, in terms of the need to identify the reproducibility of results, methods and inferences.\nIn psychological science, determining that someone can get the same results, by analysing the same data, or will reach the same conclusions from the same results, are important – potentially, original – research contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current state of the match between open science ideas and practices\nI have said that we should expect or hope to see open science practices (Munafò et al., 2017; Nosek et al., 2022) where researchers:\n\nshare data and code;\npublish research reports in ways that enable others to check or query analyses.\n\nThis raises an important question: What exactly do we see, when we look at current practices? The question is important because answering it helps to identify where the challenges are located when you complete your work to locate, access, analyse and report previously collected data.\nI break the discussion of what we see into two parts. Firstly, I look at the results of audits of data and code sharing: are data shared and can we access the data? Secondly, I discuss analyses of methods reproducibility, and shared data and code usability: can others reproduce the results reported in published articles, given shared data? can others access and run shared analysis code? can others use the shared code to reproduce the reported results? Again, I need to be brief so I reference sources that you can follow-up.\n\nThe link between the credibility revolution and the reproducibility of results\nI should be clear, before we go on, about the link between the credibility revolution in science, and the effort to examine reproducibility of results. Many elements of the credibility revolution emerged out of the observation that it has often been difficult to repeat the results of published studies when we conduct new studies (replication studies or results reproducibility; e.g., Aarts et al. (2015)). However, it is clearly difficult to know what to replicate or reproduce if we cannot reproduce the results presented in a study report (methods reproducibility), given the study data (Artner et al., 2021; Laurinavichyute et al., 2022; Minocher et al., n.d.).\n\n\nData and code sharing\nResearch on data and code sharing practices suggest that practices have improved, from earlier low levels.\nIn an important early report, Wicherts et al. (2006) observed that it was very difficult to obtain data reported in psychological research articles from the authors of the articles. They asked for data from the lead authors of 141 articles published in four leading psychology journals, for about 25% of the studies. This low response rate was found despite the fact that authors in these journals must agree to the principle that data can be shared with others wishing to verify claims.\nPractice has changed: how?\nOne change to practice has involved the use of open science badges. In journals like Psychological Science authors of articles may be awarded badges — Open Data, Open Materials, Preregistration badges — by the editorial team. Authors can apply for and earn the badges by providing information about open practices, and journal articles are published with the badges displayed near the front of the articles.\nIn theory, initiatives like encouraging authors to earn open science badges should mean that data sharing practices improve, enabling access to data and code for those, like you, who would like to re-analyse previously published data. In theory, all you should need to do — to locate and access data — is just search articles in the journal Psychological Science for studies with open data badges, and follow links from the published articles to then access study data at an open repository like the Open Science Framework (OSF) What do we see in practice?\nAnalyses reported by Kidwell et al. (2016) as well as analyses reviewed by Nosek et al. (2022) indicate that more articles have claimed to make data available in the time since badges were introduced. When they did their analysis, Kidwell et al. (2016) found that a substantial proportion, but not all, of the articles in Psychological Science can be found to actually provide access to shared data. However, critically, many but not all the articles with open data badges provide access to data available through an open repository, data that are correct, complete and usable (Kidwell et al., 2016). In their later report, the analyses reviewed by Nosek et al. (2022) suggest that the use of repositories like OSF for data sharing may be accelerating but that, over the last few years, the rate at which open science practices like sharing data, overall, appears to be substantial but not yet reported or observed in a majority of the work of researchers.\nMany journals now require the authors of articles to include a Data Availability Statement to locate their data. Analyses by Federer (2022) indicate that Data Availability Statements for articles published in the open access 4 journal PLOS ONE often, helpfully, include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) or Universal resource locators (URLs) enabling direct access to shared data (i.e., without having to contact authors). Of those DOIs or URLs, most appeared to be associated with resources that could successfully be retrieved. In contrast, analyses reported by Gabelica et al. (2022) indicate that where article authors state that “data sets are available on reasonable request” (the most common availability statement), most of the time, the authors did not respond or declined to share the data (see similar findings, across fields, by Tedersoo et al., 2021). Clearly, in the analyses of open science practices we have seen so far, data sharing is more effective where sharing does not have to work through authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are looking for a study in order to get data that you can then re-analyse, it makes sense to look, first, for studies focusing on research questions that interest you.\nWhen you are looking for published reports where the authors share data, look for articles with open science badges or where you can see a Data Availability Statement.\nChoose articles where the authors provide a direct link to their data, where the data are located on an open repository like the Open Science Framework (there are other repositories).\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling others to check or query analyses\nResearch on data and code sharing practices suggest that practices have improved but that there are concerns about the quality of the sharing. Here, the critical concern relates to the word enable in the objective: that we should publish research reports in ways that enable others to check or query analyses.\nJohn Towse and colleagues (Towse et al., 2021) at Lancaster University examined the quality of open data-sets to assess their quality in terms of their completeness and reusability (see also Roche et al., 2015).\n\ncompleteness: are all the data and the data descriptors supporting a study’s findings publicly available?\nreusability: how readily can the data be accessed and understood by others?\n\nFor a sample of data-sets, they found that about half were incomplete, and about two-thirds were shared in a way that made them difficult to use. Practices tended to be slightly better in more recent publications. (Broadly similar results are reported by (Hardwicke et al., 2018).)\nWhere data were found to be incomplete, this appeared to be, in part, because participants were excluded in the processing of the data for analysis but this information was not in the report, or because data were shared without a guide or “readme” file or data dictionary (or codebook) explaining the structure, coding or composition of the shared data.\nPotentially important for future open science practices, Towse et al. (2021; see, also, Roche et al., 2015) found that sharing data as Supplementary materials may appear to carry risks that, in the long term, mean that data may become inaccessible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nWhen you locate open data you can access, look for a guide, “readme” file, codebook or data dictionary explaining the data: you need to be able to understand what the variables are, what the observations relate to (observations per person, per trial?) and how variables are coded.\nLocate and examine carefully the parts of the published report, or the data guide, where the authors explain how they processed their data.\n\n\n\nA number of studies have been conducted to examine whether shared data and analysis code can be reused by others to reproduce the results reported in papers (e.g., Artner et al., 2021; Crüwell et al., n.d.; Hardwicke et al., n.d.; Hardwicke et al., 2018; Laurinavichyute et al., 2022; Minocher et al., n.d.; Obels et al., 2020; see Artner et al., 2021 for a review of reproducibility studies). In critical respects, the researchers doing this work are doing work similar to the work we are helping students to do, locating, accessing, and analysing previously collected data. In these studies, typically, the researchers progressed through a series of steps.\n\nSearched the articles published in a journal (e.g., Cognition, the Journal of Memory and Language, Psychological Science), published in a topic area across multiple journals (e.g., social learning, psychological research), or associated with a specific practice (e.g., registered reports.\nSelected a subset of articles where it was identified that data could be accessed.\nIdentify a target result or outcome to reproduce, for each article. In their analyses, Hardwicke and colleagues (Hardwicke et al., n.d.; Hardwicke et al., 2018) focused on attempting to reproduce primary or straightforward and substantive outcomes: substantive – if emphasized in the abstract, or presented in a table or figure; straightforward – if the outcome could be calculated using the kind of test one would learn in an introductory psychology course (e.g., t-test, correlation).\nAttempted to reproduce the results reported in the article, using the description of the data analysis presented in the article, and the analysis code (if provided), in some cases asking for information from the original study authors, in other cases working independently of original authors.\n\nWhat the reproducibility studies appear to show is that, for many published reports, if data are shared and if the shared data are accessible and reusable then, most of the time, the researchers could reproduce the results presented by the original study authors (Hardwicke et al., n.d.; Hardwicke et al., 2018; Laurinavichyute et al., 2022; Minocher et al., n.d.; Obels et al., 2020; but see Crüwell et al., n.d.). This is great. But what is interesting, for us, is where the reproducibility researchers encountered challenges. You may encounter the same or similar challenges.\nI list some challenges that the researchers describe, following. Before you look at the list, I want to assure you: you will not find all these challenges present for any one article you look at. Most likely, you will find one or two challenges. Obviously, some challenges will be more difficult than others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nWhen you find a study you are interested in, with open data and maybe open analysis code, your main challenge will often be to identify exactly what analysis the original study authors did to answer their research question.\nLocate and examine carefully the parts of the published report where the authors explain how they did the analysis that gave them their key result. Usually that key result should be identified in the abstract or in the conclusion.\n\n\n\n\nData challenges\n\nData Availability Statements or open science badges indicate data are shared but data are not directly accessible through a link to an open repository.\nThe data are shared and accessible but there is missing or incorrect information about the data. The documentation, codebook or data dictionary is missing or incomplete. There is unclear or missing information about the variables or the observations, or about the coding of variable values, responses.\nOriginal study authors may share raw and processed data or just processed or just raw data. It may not be clear how raw data were processed to construct the data analysed for the report. It may not be clear how variables were transformed or calculated or processed.\nThere may be mismatches between the variables referred to in the report and the variables named in the data file. It may be unclear how a data file corresponds to a study described in a report, where there are multiple studies and multiple data files.\n\n\n\nAnalysis challenges\n\nThe original report includes a description of the analysis but the description of the analysis procedure is incomplete or ambiguous.\nThere may be a mismatch, in the report, between a hypothesis, and the analysis specified to test the hypothesis (maybe in the Methods section), compared to a long sequence of results reported in the Results section. This makes it difficult to identify the key analysis.\nIt is easier to reproduce results if both data and code are shared because the presentation of the analysis code usually (not always) makes clear what analysis was done to get the results presented in the report.\nSometimes, analysis code is shared but it is difficult to use because it requires proprietary software (e.g., SPSS) or because it requires function libraries that are no longer publicly available.\nSometimes, there are errors in the analysis. Sometimes, there are errors in the presentation of the results, where results have been incorrectly copied into reports from analysis outputs.",

    "text": "This is why\nThe research report assignment requires students to locate, access, analyse and report previously collected data. At the start of the introduction, I said I would explain the answer to the question:\n\nWhy: what is the motivation for the assignment?\n\nI summarize, following, the main points of the answer I have given. When you review these points, I want you to think about two things, returning to the ideas of Bourdieu (2004) and Kuhn (1970) I sketched at the start.\nOften what we do in science is guided by convention, the assumptions and habits of normal practice (Kuhn, 1970). These conventions can work in our minds so that if we encounter an anomaly or discrepancy between what we expect and what we find, in our work, we may usually blame ourselves: it was something wrong that we did or failed to do. It can cause us anxiety if we do not reproduce a result we think we should be able to reproduce (Lubega et al., n.d.). But I want you to understand, from the start, that sometimes, if you think you have found an error or a problem in a published analysis or a shared data-set, you may be right.\nIf there is anything we have learned, through the findings of replication studies, multiverse analyses, and reproducibility audits it is that people make mistakes, different choices are often reasonable, and we always need to check the evidence.\n\nSummary: this is why\n\nWe are in the middle of a credibility revolution. The lessons we have learned so far oblige us to think about and to teach good open science practices that safeguard the value of evidence in psychology.\nThis matters, even if we do not care about scientific methods, because if we care about the translation into policy or practice – in clinical psychology, in education, health, marketing and other fields – what we do will depend on the value of the research evidence that informs policy ideas or practice guides.\nFocusing on data analysis, it is useful to think about the whole data pipeline in analysis, the workflow that takes us from data collection to raw data to data processing to analysis to the presentation of results.\nAt every stage of the data pipeline, there are choices about what to do. There are not always reasons why we make one choice instead of another. Sometimes, we are guided by convention, example or instruction.\nThe existence of choices means the path we take, when we do data analysis, can be one path among multiple different forking paths.\nFor some parts of the pipeline – data-set construction, data analysis choices – reasonable people might make different decisions to sensibly answer the same research question, given the same data. This variation between pathways can be more or less important in influencing the results we see.\nIf results tend to stay similar across different ways of doing analysis, we might conclude that the results are reasonably robust across contexts, choices, or other variation in methods.\nTo enable others to see what we did (versus what we could have done), to see how we got to our results from our data, it is important to share our data and code.\nEveryone makes mistakes and we should make it easy for others, and ourselves, to find those mistakes by sharing our data and code in accessible, clear, usable ways.\nWe need to teach and learn how to share effectively the data and the code that we used to answer our research questions.\n\nIn constructing the assignment – in asking and supporting students to locate, access, analyse and report previously collected data – we are presenting an opportunity to really investigate and evaluate existing practices.\nYou may find that this work is challenging, in some of the places that reproducibility research has identified there can be challenges. Where the challenges cannot be fixed – if you have found an interesting study but the study data are inaccessible or unusable – we will advise you to move on to another study. Where the challenges can be fixed – if data require processing, or if analysis information requires clarification – we will provide you with help or enabling information so that you fix the problems yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nMaybe the main lesson from this exercise is a reminder of the Golden rule: treat others as you would like to be treated.\nIf it is frustrating when it is difficult to understand information about an analysis or about data, or when it is difficult to access and reuse shared data and code.\nWhen it is your turn — do better — reflecting on what frustrated you.\n\n\n\nOne last question: why not just do less demanding or challenging tasks? Because this is part of what makes graduate degree valuable, what will make you more skilled in the workplace. Most of the time, we work in teams, we inherit problems or data analysis tasks, or are given results with partial information. The lessons you learn here will help you to effectively navigate those situations.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAarts, E., Dolan, C. V., Verhage, M., & Van der Sluis, S. (2015).

Then you will see information about the practical materials you can use to build and practise your skills.\nEvery week, you will learn best if you first watch the lectures then do the practical exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinked resources\n\n\n\n\nIn the chapter for week 7, we share materials to support your development of critical thinking about associations, and your development of practical skills in working with correlation-based analyses.\nIn the chapter for week 8, we introduce you to the main ideas and practical steps involved in conducting linear model analyses.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.1 Lectures\nThe lecture materials for this week are presented in four short parts.\nClick on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part.\n\nPart 1 (20 minutes) Developing the linear model: The concepts and skills we will learn about in week 10: our aims, the research questions we can answer with linear models, making the move to working with linear models with multiple predictors, why the main challenge is not the coding but the choices over which predictors to include in a model.\n\n\n\nPart 2 (13 minutes): Coding, thinking about, and reporting linear models with multiple predictors.\n\n\n\nPart 3 (21 minutes): Critically evaluating the results of analyses involving linear models.\n\n\n\nPart 4 (19 minutes): The linear model is very flexible, powerful and general.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.2 Lecture slides\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the lecture slides\n\n\n\nThe slides presented in the videos can be downloaded here:\n\nThe slides exactly as presented (11 MB).\n\nYou can download the web page .html file and click on it to open it in any browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge or Safari). The slide images are high quality so the file is quite big and may take a few seconds to download.\n\n\nWe are going to work through some practical exercises, next, to develop your critical thinking and practical skills for working with linear models.\n\n\n10.4 Practical materials: data and R-Studio\nWe will work with one data file which you can download by clicking on its name (below):\n\n2022-12-08_all-studies-subject-scores.csv.\n\nOnce you have downloaded the file, you will need to upload it to the R-Studio server to access it so that you can do the practical exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nHere is a link to the sign-in page for R-Studio Server\n\n\n\n\n10.4.1 Practical materials guide\nAs usual, you will find that the practical exercises are simpler to do if you follow these steps in order.\n\nThe data — We will take a quick look at what is inside the data files so you know what everything means.\nThe how-to guide — We will go through the practical analysis and visualization coding steps, showing all the code required for each step.\nThe practical exercises — We will set out the tasks, questions and challenges that you should complete to learn the practical skills we target this week.\n\nThis week — Week 10 — we aim to further develop skills in working with the linear model, and in visualizing and testing the associations between variables in psychological data.\n\nWhile we build on everything you have learned so far, the skills you learn in this class unlock your capacity to analyse most kinds of data you will encounter in most situations: a big expansion in the scope of your capacities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 10 parts\n\n\n\n\nSet-up\nLoad the data\nRevision: using a linear model to answer research questions – one predictor.\nNew: using a linear model to answer research questions – multiple predictors.\nNew: plot predictions from linear models with multiple predictors.\nNew: estimate the effects of factors as well as numeric variables.\nNew: examine associations comparing data from different samples.\n\n\n\nWe learn these skills so that we can answer research questions like:\n\nWhat person attributes predict success in understanding?\n\nQuestions like this are often answered by analyzing psychological data using some form of linear model.\nAs usual, when we do these analyses, we need to think about how we report the results, so part of the learning you will complete will enable you to:\n\nreport information about the kind of model you specify;\nreport the nature of the associations (or effects) estimated in your model;\nevaluate the results, making decisions about (i.) the significance of effects (ii.) whether estimates of effects suggest a positive or negative relationship between outcome and predictor (iii.) whether estimates of effects suggest a strong or a weak relationship.\n\nWe will really strengthen your ability to produce professional visualizations by learning how to translate model results into plots that help you and your audience to translate what your model tells you into accurate understanding and plain language.\n\n10.4.1.1 The data files\nEach of the data files we have worked with has had a similar structure. This week, that continuity remains. But, this week, we move on to working with a big data-set similar to the data you may encounter in real-world situations.\n\nWhat is new about this data-set is that it holds data from multiple studies in which the same methods were used – these are replication studies – enabling us to look the questions about results reproducibility across studies that you have been hearing about.\n\nHere are what

required to present table summaries of the variables in your data, incorporating descriptive statistics.\n\nYou can use the describe() function to get R to do the work for you.\n\nWe want to get just the descriptive statistics we want.\nWe are going to do this in two steps:\n\nwe select the variables we care about;\nwe get just the descriptive statistics we want for those variables\n\nWe will do this using two different but equivalent methods.\nFirst, we are going to do this using the %&gt;% pipes that you saw previously (in week 5):\n\nall.studies.subjects %&gt;%\n  select(mean.acc, mean.self, AGE, SHIPLEY, HLVA, FACTOR3) %&gt;%\n  describe(skew = FALSE)\n\n          vars   n  mean    sd   min max range   se\nmean.acc     1 561  0.73  0.21  0.15   1  0.85 0.01\nmean.self    2 561

     6 615 44.03 14.67  0.00  63 63.00 0.59\n\n\nThese are the code elements and what they do:\n\nall.studies.subjects %&gt;% – you tell R to use the all.studies.subjects dataset, then use %&gt;% to ask R to take those data to the next step.\nselect(mean.acc, mean.self, AGE, SHIPLEY, HLVA, FACTOR3) %&gt;% – you tell R to select just those variables in all.studies.subjects that you name and %&gt;% pipe them to the next step.\ndescribe(...) – you tell R to give you descriptive statistics for the variables you have selected.\ndescribe(skew = FALSE) – critically, you add the argument skew = FALSE to turn off the option in describe() to report skew, kurtosis: because we do not typically see these statistics reported in psychology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nModern R coding often uses the pipe. When you see it, you see it used in a process involving a series of steps.\n\nDo this thing, then send the results %&gt; to the next step, do the next thing then send the results %&gt;% to the next step…\nWhen you look at ggplot() code, the + at the end of each line of plotting code is doing a similar job to the pipe.\n\n\n\nNot everyone is comfortable coding this way so next we will do the same thing in an old style.\n\nall.studies.subjects.select &lt;- select(all.studies.subjects, \n                           mean.acc, mean.self, AGE, SHIPLEY, HLVA, FACTOR3)\ndescribe(all.studies.subjects.select, skew = FALSE)\n\n          vars   n  mean    sd   min max range   se\nmean.acc     1 561  0.73  0.21  0.15   1  0.85 0.01\nmean.self    2 561  6.53  1.72  1.00   9  8.00 0.07\nAGE          3 615 28.34 13.56 18.00 100 82.00 0.55\nSHIPLEY      4 615 28.98  9.52  0.00  40 40.00 0.38\nHLVA         5 615  7.22  3.09  0.00  13 13.00 0.12\nFACTOR3      6 615 44.03 14.67  0.00  63 63.00 0.59\n\n\nThese are the code elements and what they do:\n\nall.studies.subjects.select &lt;- ...(all.studies.subjects, ...) – you tell R to create a new dataset all.studies.subjects.select from the original all.studies.subjects – the new dataset will include just the variables we select from the original.\nselect(all.studies.subjects, ...) – you tell R to select the variables you want using the select(...) function: telling R to select variables from all.studies.subjects.\n... select(..., mean.acc, mean.self, AGE, SHIPLEY, HLVA, FACTOR3) – you tell R to select the variables you want by entering the variable names, separated by commas, after you have named the dataset.\ndescribe(...) – you tell R to give you descriptive statistics.\ndescribe(all.studies.subjects.select, ...) – you name the dataset with the selection of variables you have created, telling the describe() function what data to work with.\ndescribe(skew = FALSE) – critically, you add the argument skew = FALSE to turn off the option to report skew, kurtosis to keep the descriptive statistics short.\n\nWhat are we learning here?\nFirst, we can do exactly the same thing in two different but related ways:\n\nUse the way that (1.) works and (2.) you prefer.\nWhich should you prefer? You may reflect on how easy the code is to write, read, understand and use\n\nSecond, we modify how the function describe() works by adding an argument: describe(skew = FALSE).\n\nWe have been doing this kind of move, already, by adding arguments to, e.g., specify point colour in ggplot() code.\n\nAs your skills advance, so your preferences on how you want R to work for you will become more specific.\n\nYou can modify the outputs from functions so that you get exactly what you want in the way that you want it.\n\nThe information on the options available to you for any argument can be found in different kinds of places, see the further information box, below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information you can explore\n\n\n\n\nHere is an explanation for how to use pipes %&gt;% when you code and why it may be helpful to do so:\n\nhttps://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html\nNote that we do not require the use of pipes in PSYC411: we are showing you this to expand your knowledge.\n\nYou can get a guide to the {psych} library here:\n\nhttp://personality-project.org/r/psych/vignettes/intro.pdf\nEvery “official” R library has a technical manual on the central R resource CRAN, and the manual for ‘psych’ can be found here:\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/psych.pdf\n\nwhere you can see information on the functions the library provides, and how you can use each function.\n\nThis is how you ask for help in R for a function, e.g., just type: ?describe or help(describe).\nThe {psych} library is written by William Revelle who provides a lot of useful resources here:\nhttp://personality-project.org/r/psych/\n\n\n\n\n\n10.4.2.3 How-to Part 3: Using a linear model to answer research questions – one predictor\n\nHow-to Task 5 – Examine the relation between outcome mean accuracy (mean.acc) and health literacy (HLVA)\nOne of our research questions is:\n\nWhat person attributes predict success in understanding?\n\nHere, we can address the question directly because we have information on an outcome, mean accuracy (mean.acc), and information on a predictor, health literacy (HLVA).\n\nGiven the theoretical account outlined in the chapter for week 7, our hypothesis is that people who possess a higher level of background knowledge, measured here using the health literacy (HLVA) test, will be more likely to accurately understand health information when they read it, with understanding tested to calculate the mean accuracy (mean.acc).\nThis hypothesis translates into a statistical prediction: if people in our sample have higher HLVA scores, we predict that, on average, they will also have higher mean.acc scores.\n\nTo address the research question, we test the statistical prediction using the linear model:\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mean.acc ~ HLVA, data = all.studies.subjects)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mean.acc ~ HLVA, data = all.studies.subjects)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.59375 -0.11731  0.02981  0.13269  0.37100 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The R-squared suggests that 23% of outcome variance can be explained # by the model\n\n\n\n\nWhat are we learning here?\nIt is worth your time reflecting, here, on how statistical analyses are incorporated in research work.\n\nWe have ideas about a psychological process: e.g., reading comprehension.\nWe have assumptions of a theoretical account of that process: e.g., we use background knowledge to understand what we read.\nGiven those assumptions, we derive hypotheses that we translate into statistical predictions: e.g., higher health literacy predicts higher accuracy of understanding.\nWe test a statistical prediction using a method like lm(), specifying a model that aligns with the prediction terms: the outcome, the predictor(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThinking ahead to your dissertation project, can you reflect on the research question you will hope to answer, how you will address that question through measurement, then data analysis to test a statistical prediction?\n\n\n\n\n\n10.4.2.4 How-to Part 4: Using a linear model to answer research questions – multiple predictors\n\nHow-to Task 6 –Examine the relation between outcome mean accuracy (mean.acc) and multiple predictors including: health literacy (HLVA); vocabulary (SHIPLEY); AGE; reading strategy (FACTOR3)\nWe saw that our research question is:\n\nWhat person attributes predict success in understanding?\n\nIn the previous task, we tried to model success in understanding using just one predictor variable but it is unrealistic that a person’s capacity to understand health information will be predicted by just one thing, their background knowledge. It is more likely that variation on multiple dimensions will predict understanding.\nWhat could those variables be?\nWe can examine the relation between outcome mean accuracy (mean.acc) and multiple predictors simultaneously. Here, the candidate predictor variables include: health literacy (HLVA); vocabulary (SHIPLEY); AGE; reading strategy (FACTOR3).\nWe can incorporate all predictors together in a linear model: we use lm(), as before, but now specify each variable listed here by variable name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mean.acc ~ HLVA + SHIPLEY + FACTOR3 + AGE, data = all.studies.subjects)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mean.acc ~ HLVA + SHIPLEY + FACTOR3 + AGE, data = all.studies.subjects)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.57543 -0.08115  0.02303  0.11169  0.38810 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

What do you conclude is the answer to the research question, given the linear model results?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.10. The model slope estimate 0.0274954 suggests that as HLVA scores # increase so also do mean.acc scores\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.11. How is the coefficient estimate for the HLVA slope similar or different, comparing this model with multiple predictors to the previous model with one predictor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.11. It can be seen that the HLVA estimate in the two models is different in that it is a bit smaller in the model with multiple predictors compared to the model with one predictor. The HLVA estimate is similar in that it remains positive, and it is about the same size.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are we learning here?\nThe estimate of the coefficient of any one predictor can be expected to vary depending on the presence of other predictors.\n\nThis is one reason why we need to be transparent about why we choose to use the predictors we include in our model.\nThe lecture for this week discusses this concern in relation to the motivation for good open science practices.\n\n\nQ.12. Can you report the estimated effect of SHIPLEY (the measure of vocabulary)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.12. The effect of vocabulary knowledge (SHIPLEY) on mean accuracy of understanding is significant (estimate = 0.01, t = 7.30, p &lt; .001), indicating that increasing skill is associated with increasing accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.13. Can you report the model and the model fit statistics?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.13. We fitted a linear model with mean comprehension accuracy as the outcome and health literacy (HLVA), reading strategy (FACTOR3), vocabulary (SHIPLEY) and AGE (in years) as predictors. The model is significant overall, with F(4, 556) = 85.17, p &lt; .001, and explains 38% of variance (adjusted R2 = 0.38).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.4.2.5 How-to Part 5: Plot predictions from linear models with multiple predictors\n\nHow-to Task 7 – Produce and plot model results using R functions that make the process easier\nWe can begin by plotting linear model predictions for one of the predictors in the multiple predictors model we have been working with.\n\nPreviously, we used geom_abline(), specifying intercept and slope estimates, to produce and plot model predictions.\nHere, we use functions that are very helpful when we need to plot model predictions for a predictor, for models where we have multiple predictors.\n\nWe do this in three steps:\n\nWe first fit a linear model of the outcome, given our predictors, and we save information about the model.\nWe use the ggpredict() function from the {ggeffects} library to take the information about the model and create a set of predictions we can use for plotting.\nWe plot the model predictions, producing what are also called marginal effects plots.\n\nWe write the code to do the work as follows.\n\nWe first fit a linear model of the outcome, given our predictors:\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mean.acc ~ HLVA + SHIPLEY + FACTOR3 + AGE, \n                         data = all.studies.subjects)\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(...) – we fit the model using lm(...), giving the model a name: “model”.\n...lm(mean.acc ~ HLVA + ... + ...) – this model estimates how the outcome mean.acc changes, is predicted ~ given information about the predictors HLVA, SHIPLEY, FACTOR3, and AGE.\nNotice: when we use lm() to fit the model, R creates a set of information about the model, including estimates.\nWe give that set of information a name (“model”), and we use that name, next, to call on and use the model information to make the plot.\n\n\nWe use the ggpredict() function from the {ggeffects} library to take the information about the model and create a set of predictions we can use for plotting:\n\n\ndat &lt;- ggpredict(model, \"HLVA\")\n\n\ndat &lt;- ggpredict(...) – we ask R to create a set of predictions, and we give that set of predictions a name dat.\n... ggpredict(model, \"HLVA\") – we tell R what model information it should use (from “model”), and which predictor variable we need predictions for: HLVA.\n\n\nWe plot the model predictions (marginal effects plots):\n\n\nplot(dat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information you can explore\n\n\n\nIn producing prediction plots, we are using functions from the {ggeffects} library. Can you locate online information about working with the library functions?\n\nTry doing a search with the key words: in r ggeffects.\n\nIf you do that, you will see links to the website:\nhttps://strengejacke.github.io/ggeffects/\nIn the {ggeffects} online information, you can see links to practical examples. Can you use the information under Practical examples to adjust the appearance of the prediction plots?\n\n\n\n\nHow-to Task 8 – Optional – Edit the appearance of the marginal effect (prediction) plot as you can with any ggplot object\nOnce we have created the model predictions plot, we can edit it like we would edit any other ggplot object.\n\nThis is clearly advanced but it helps you to see just how powerful your capabilities can be if you aim to develop skills in this kind of work.\n\n\np.model &lt;- plot(dat)\np.model +\n  geom_point(data = all.studies.subjects, \n             aes(x = HLVA, y = mean.acc), size = 1.5, alpha = .75, colour = \"lightgreen\") +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +\n  ylim(0, 1.1) + xlim(0, 16) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(size =

of health literacy on mean comprehension accuracy\")\n\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 54 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do this in stages, as we have done for other kinds of plots:\n\np.model &lt;- plot(dat) – we create a plot object, which we call ‘p.model’.\np.model + – we then set up the first line of a series of code lines, starting with the name of the plot, p.model and a + to show we are going to add some edits.\ngeom_point(data = all.studies.subjects, aes(x = HLVA, y = mean.acc) ...) – we first add the raw data points showing the observed HLVA and mean.acc for each person in our sample.\ngeom_point(... size = 1.5, alpha = .75, colour = \"lightgreen\") + – we modify the appearance of the points, then\ngeom_line(size = 1.5) + – we add the prediction line, using the predictions created earlier, then\nylim(0, 1.1) + xlim(0, 16) + – we set axis limits to show the full potential range of variation in each variable, then\ntheme_bw() – we set the theme to black and white, then\ntheme(axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.15)), ...) – we modify the relative size of x-axis, y-axis and plot title label font, then\nxlab(\"Health literacy (HLVA)\") + ylab(\"Mean accuracy\") + – we edit labels to make them easier to understand, then\nggtitle(\"Effect of health literacy on mean comprehension accuracy\") – we give the plot a title\n\nNotice that we are constructing a complex plot from two datasets:\n\nWe use plot(dat) to construct a plot from (1.) the set of predictions, showing the prediction line using geom_line(size = 1.5) +\nWe then add a layer to the plot to show (2.) the raw sample data, using geom_point(data = all.studies.subjects, ...) – to tell R to work with the sample data-set all.studies.subjects, and to show points representing the (aesthetic mappings) values, given that sample data, for (x = HLVA, y = mean.acc).\n\nWhat are we learning here?\nThis complex plot is a good example of:\n\nHow we can plot summary of prediction data plus observed outcomes, and this connects to the classes on visualization.\nHow we can add layers of edits, or geometric objects, together to create complex plots that can show our audience messages like, here, that there is an average trend (shown by the line) but that individual outcomes vary quite a bit from the average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNo model will be perfect.\n\nIt is often useful to compare model estimates – here, the slopes – with the raw data observations.\nVisualizing the difference between what we observe and what we predict helps to make sense of how our prediction model could be improved.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow-to Task 9 – Optional – Now produce plots that show the predictions for all the predictor variables in the model\nThis is optional but we offer the task as an opportunity for practice with these notes.\n\nThe code may get pretty lengthy.\nYou will need to adjust axis labels so for each plot we see the correct predictor as the x-axis label\nYou will give the plot titles as letters a-e so that, if you put this plot in a report, you can refer to each plot by letter in comments in a report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will use the {Patchwork} library:\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nFirst, fit the model and get the model information:\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mean.acc ~ HLVA + SHIPLEY + FACTOR3 + AGE, \n                         data = all.studies.subjects)\n\nSecond, get the predictions, given the model information, for two different predictor variables.\n\nNotice that I use different names for different sets of predictors.\n\n\ndat.HLVA &lt;- ggpredict(model, \"HLVA\")\ndat.SHIPLEY &lt;- ggpredict(model, \"SHIPLEY\")\n\nThird, produce plots of the predictions, giving each plot object a different plot name.\n\nNotice that I use different names for different sets of predictors.\n\n\nplot.HLVA &lt;- plot(dat.HLVA)\nplot.SHIPLEY &lt;- plot(dat.SHIPLEY)\n\nLast, put the two plots together by calling their names.\n\nplot.HLVA + plot.SHIPLEY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe {Patchwork} library functions are really powerful and the documentation information is really helpful:\nhttps://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/patchwork.html\n\n\n\nWhat are we learning here?\nIf you follow the code example, and learn how to:\n\ncomplete a linear model analysis with multiple predictors and\npresent the model results, for all effects (estimates of the impact of all predictors) simultaneously\n\n\nthen this is a big deal, as a skill development learning achievement\nbecause knowing about this process, and knowing how to do it, unlocks an important advanced analysis and visualization skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nKnowing how to follow this model \\(\\rightarrow\\) visualization workflow gives you a competitive advantage in future professional settings (job applications, interviews, workplace) because not many Psychology graduates can do it, yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.4.2.6 How-to Part 6: New: estimate the effects of factors as well as numeric variables\nAs we have seen, one of our research questions is:\n\nWhat person attributes predict success in understanding?\n\nWe have not yet included any categorical or nominal variables as predictors but we can, and should: lm() can cope with any kind of variable as a predictor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn Part 4 of the Week 10 lectures, I explain that fundamentally every kind of analysis you have learnt before (t-test, ANOVA, etc.) can be understood as a kind of linear model. This part shows how that works.\n\nIn a (two groups) t-test, you are comparing the average outcome between two different groups.\nTo do that analysis, you need an outcome variable (like mean.acc) and a categorical variable or factor (like, say, experimental condition: condition 1 versus condition 2).\nHere, we see how you can do the same kind of group comparison using a linear model.\n\n\n\nThere are different ways to do this, here we look at one. Extra information about the second can be found in the drop-down box, following.\n\nHow-to Task 10 – Fit a linear model including both numeric variables and categorical variables as predictors model including both numeric variables and categorical variables as predictors\nWe begin by inspecting the data to check what variables are categorical or nominal variables – factors – using summary().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(all.studies.subjects)\n\n  ResponseId           mean.acc       mean.self          AGE        \n Length:615         Min.   :0.150   Min.   :1.000   Min.   : 18.00  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:0.600   1st Qu.:5.600   1st Qu.: 20.00  \n Mode  :character   Median :0.800   Median :6.800   Median : 23.00  \n                    Mean   :0.734   Mean   :6.529   Mean   : 28.34  \n                    3rd Qu.:0.900   3rd Qu.:7.800   3rd Qu.: 30.50  \n                    Max.   :1.000   Max.   :9.000   Max.   :100.00  \n                    NA's   :54      NA's   :54                      \n    GENDER           EDUCATION          ETHNICITY            SHIPLEY     \n Length:615         Length:615         Length:615         Min.   : 0.00  \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:25.00  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :32.00  \n                                                          Mean   :28.98  \n                                                          3rd Qu.:36.00  \n                                                          Max.   :40.00  \n                                                                         \n      HLVA           FACTOR3      NATIVE.LANGUAGE       study          \n Min.   : 0.000   Min.   : 0.00   Length:615         Length:615        \n 1st Qu.: 5.000   1st Qu.:41.00   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median : 8.000   Median :48.00   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 7.224   Mean   :44.03                                        \n 3rd Qu.: 9.500   3rd Qu.:53.00                                        \n Max.   :13.000   Max.   :63.00                                        \n                                                                       \n\n\n\n\n\nsummary() gives you the information you need because R shows factors with a count of the number of observations for each level.\nWe can build on our previous work by including the factor NATIVE.LANGUAGE as a predictor:\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mean.acc ~ HLVA + SHIPLEY + FACTOR3 + AGE + NATIVE.LANGUAGE, \n            data = all.studies.subjects)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mean.acc ~ HLVA + SHIPLEY + FACTOR3 + AGE + NATIVE.LANGUAGE, \n    data = all.studies.subjects)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.55939 -0.08115  0.02056  0.10633  0.41598 \n\nCoefficients:\n                       Estimate Std.

Can you report the estimated effect of NATIVE.LANGUAGE (the coding of participant language status: English versus Other)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.14. The effect of language status (NATIVE.LANGUAGE) on mean accuracy of understanding is significant (estimate = -0.09, t = -6.37, p &lt; .001) indicating that not being a native speaker of English (‘Other’) is associated with lower accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.15. Can you report the model and the model fit statistics?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.15. We fitted a linear model with mean comprehension accuracy as the outcome and health literacy (HLVA), reading strategy (FACTOR3), vocabulary (SHIPLEY) and AGE (years), as well as language status as predictors. The model is significant overall, with F(5, 555) = 81.09, p &lt; .001, and explains 42% of variance (adjusted R2 = 0.42).\n\n\n\n\n\nQ.16. What changes, when you compare the models with versus without NATIVE.LANGUAGE?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.16. If you compare the summaries, for the last two models, you can see that the proportion of variance explained, R-sq, increases to 42% (0.4221), suggesting that knowing about participant language background helps to account for their response accuracy in tests of comprehension of health advice.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are we learning here?\nWhat are factors?\n\nA factor is a categorical variable.\nCategorical variables have a “fixed and known set of possible values”, for example, maybe you are working with the factor EDUCATION: in the data collection process, answers to the question “What is your education level?” can have only one of three possible values (further, higher, secondary).\nFor any factor, different values of the variable are called levels so, for EDUCATION the different levels are: further, higher, secondary\n\nR treats factors differently from other kinds of variables:\n\nR will not give you summary statistics (e.g., a mean) for values of a factor. It can’t because: what is the mean of education?\nR will count the number of times each level in a factor appears in a sample.\nIf you are plotting a bar chart or a boxplot to show outcomes for different groups or conditions then the group or condition coding variable (e.g., aes(x = group)) has to be a factor.\n\nR handles factors, by default, by picking one level (e.g., English) as the reference level (or baseline) and comparing outcomes to that baseline, for each other factor level (here, Other).\n\nThis is why, in the summary of estimates for this model, the effect of NATIVE.LANGUAGE is estimated as the average difference in mean.acc outcome for English compared to Other participants.\nThis is why the effect is listed as: NATIVE.LANGUAGEOther in the summary table for the model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information you can explore\n\n\n\nNote that I quote, here, from the powerful {forcats} library of tools for working with factors:\nhttps://forcats.tidyverse.org/\nYou can read more about factor coding schemes here:\nhttps://talklab.psy.gla.ac.uk/tvw/catpred/\nand here:\nhttps://phillipalday.com/stats/coding.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra information for students interested in ANOVAs\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are different ways to code factors for analysis:\n\nIf you are doing an analysis where your data come from, say, a factorial design (e.g. a 2 x 2 study design) then you will want to use a different coding scheme: sum or effect coding.\n\nIt is easy to do this, in two steps, proceeding as follows.\n\nWe first change the coding scheme.\n\n\nGet the {memisc} library:\n\n\nlibrary(memisc)\n\n\nMake sure that the variable is being treated as a factor:\n\n\nall.studies.subjects$NATIVE.LANGUAGE &lt;- as.factor(all.studies.subjects$NATIVE.LANGUAGE)\n\n\nCheck the coding:\n\n\ncontrasts(all.studies.subjects$NATIVE.LANGUAGE)\n\n        Other\nEnglish     0\nOther       1\n\n\n\nChange the coding\n\n\ncontrasts(all.studies.subjects$NATIVE.LANGUAGE) &lt;- contr.sum(2, base = 1)\n\nThe arguments in contr.sum(2, base = 1) tell R which level we want to be the reference level.\n\nCheck the coding to show you got what you want:\n\n\ncontrasts(all.studies.subjects$NATIVE.LANGUAGE)\n\n         2\nEnglish -1\nOther    1\n\n\n\nWe then fit a linear model of the outcome, given our predictors:\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mean.acc ~ HLVA + SHIPLEY + FACTOR3 + AGE + NATIVE.LANGUAGE, \n            data = all.studies.subjects)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mean.acc ~ HLVA + SHIPLEY + FACTOR3 + AGE + NATIVE.LANGUAGE, \n    data = all.studies.subjects)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.55939 -0.08115  0.02056  0.10633  0.41598 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

If you compare the summaries, for the last two models, you can see that the estimate for the coefficient of NATIVE.LANGUAGE changes in two ways:\n\n\n\nthe name changes, from NATIVE.LANGUAGEOther to NATIVE.LANGUAGE2, reflecting the change in coding;\n\n\n\n\nthe slope estimate changes, from -0.0900035 to -0.0450018.\n\n\n\nNote: the change in the estimate happens because we go from estimating the average difference in level between 0 (English) versus 1 (Other), a change of one unit to estimating the average difference in level between -1 (English) versus 1 (Other), a change of 2 units.\n\nBeing able to change the coding of nominal or categorical variables is very useful.

Or people could (2.) be good at judging their own understanding (mean.self) so that they can then be accurate in their understanding of what they read. This is not just a tricksy way of talking: it could be that people who are good at evaluating if they understand what they read are able to work more effectively at that understanding, or the opposite could be the case.\nThe direction of cause-and-effect is just unclear, here.\n\nPractical Task 7 – We cannot actually resolve the question of causality but we can learn a lot if we look at two models incorporating the same variables\n\nIf we focus on whether (predictor) mean.self predicts (outcome) mean.acc then the model should be: mean.acc ~ mean.self\nIf we focus on whether (predictor) mean.acc predicts (outcome) mean.self then the model should be: mean.self ~ mean.acc\n\nThe two models involve the same variables but arrange the variables differently, in the code, depending on which variable is specified as the outcome versus which variable is specified as the predictor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that the comparison between these models teaches us something about what it is that linear models predict.\n\nYou want to focus on the estimate of the coefficient of the predictor variable, for each model, presented in the model summary results.\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.17.

Why do you think it appears that the slope coefficient estimate is different if you compare:\n\n\n(1.) the model, mean.acc ~ mean.self\n\n\nversus\n\n\n(2.) the model, mean.self ~ mean.acc?\n\n\nHint: You may benefit by reflecting on the lectures and practical materials in the chapter for week 8, especially where they concern predictions.\n\n\nPract.A.18. Linear models are prediction models. We use them to predict variation in outcomes given some set of predictor variables. Because of this, predictions must be scaled in the same way as the outcome variable.\n\n\nSo:\n\n\n(1.) the model mean.acc ~ mean.self identifies mean.acc as the outcome so if we are predicting change in mean.acc (scaled 0-1) then we are looking at coefficients that will lie somewhere on the same scale (also 0-1).\n\n\nHere: the model suggests that unit change in mean.self predicts increase of 0.058613 in mean.acc.\n\n\nVersus:\n\n\n(2.) the model, mean.self ~ mean.acc identifies mean.self as the outcome so if we are predicting change in mean.self (scaled 1-9) then we are looking at coefficients that will lie somewhere on the same scale (also 1-9).\n\n\nHere: the model suggests that unit change in mean.acc predicts increase of 3.9135 in mean.self.\n\n\nPract.Q.19.

width, height and resolution (in dpi).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information you can explore\n\n\n\nCheck out reference information here:\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html\nand\nhttp://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Output_to_a_file/\n\n\n\n\nPractical Task Optional: Now try it for yourself: make a plot, and save it, using what you have learnt so far\nYou will need to:\n\nFit a model\nCreate a set of predictions we can use for plotting\nMake a plot\nSave it\n\nThen, you can import the saved plot into Word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nFit a model:\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mean.acc ~ HLVA + SHIPLEY + FACTOR3 + AGE,\n            data = all.studies.subjects)\n\nCreate a set of predictions we can use for plotting\n\ndat &lt;- ggpredict(model, \"FACTOR3\")\n\nMake a plot\n\np.model &lt;- plot(dat)\np.model +\n  geom_point(data = all.studies.subjects,\n             aes(x = FACTOR3, y = mean.acc), size = 1.5, alpha = .75, colour = \"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.15)),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = rel(1.25)),\n

10, height = 10, units = \"cm\")\n\nWarning: Removed 54 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nSome advice:\n\nIt is often helpful to present plots that are almost square i.e. height about = width.\nThis helps to present the best fit line in scatterplots in a way that is easier to perceive.\nWe may experiment with width-height (aspect ratio) until we get something that “looks” right.\nNotice also that different presentation venues will require different levels if image resolution e.g. journals may require .tiff file plots at dpi = 180 or greater.\n\n\n\n\nThe answers\nAfter the practical class, we will reveal the answers that are currently hidden.\nThe answers version of the webpage will present my answers for questions, and some extra information where that is helpful.\n\n\nLook ahead: growing in independence\n\nGeneral advice\nAn old saying goes:\n\nAll models are wrong but some are useful\n\n(attributed to George Box).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, it can be useful to adopt a simpler approach as a way to approximate get closer to better methods\nBox also advises:\n\n\nSince all models are wrong the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong. It is inappropriate to be concerned about mice when there are tigers abroad.\n\n\nHere, we focus on validity, measurement, generalizability and critical thinking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nLinear models\n\n\nLinear models are a very general, flexible, and powerful analysis method\nWe can use assuming that prediction outcomes (residuals) are normally distributed\nWith potentially multiple predictor variables\n\n\nThinking about linear models\n\n\nClosing the loop: when we plan an analysis we should try to use contextual information – theory and measurement understanding – to specify our model\nClosing the loop: when we critically evaluate our or others’ findings, we should consider validity, measurement, and generalizability\n\n\nReporting linear models\n\n\nWhen we report an analysis, we should report:\n\n\nExplain what I did, specifying the method (linear model), the outcome variable (accuracy) and the predictor variables (health literacy, reading strategy, reading skill and vocabulary)\nReport the model fit statistics overall (\\(F, R^2\\))\nReport the significant effects (\\(\\beta, t, p\\)) and describe the nature of the effects (does the outcome increase or decrease?)",

Then you will see information about the practical exercises you can use to build and practise your skills.\nEvery week, you will learn best if you first watch the lectures then do the practical exercises.\nYou will realize that we are helping to build familiarity and fluency in your practical skills through the accumulation of practice, and the step-by-step extension of capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinked resources\n\n\n\n\nIn PSYC411: in Week 3, we started learning about histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, and boxplots; in Week 4, we revisited bar charts and scatterplots; in Week 5, we revised boxplots.\nIn PSYC411: in Week 7, we consolidated and extended your skills with scatterplots, and practised how to read plots.\nIn PSYC411: in Week 8, we consolidated and extended your skills with both histograms and scatterplots; learning to combine analysis with visualization.\nIn PSYC413: in Week 9, in the visualizations perspective class, we explore more broadly why being able to produce and read data visualizations is now an important sought-after skill.\nIn PSYC411: in Week 10, we explore how to use convenience functions to do visualization tasks automatically. We reach the most advanced kind of plots: presenting model estimates with raw data.\n\n\n\n\nThroughout our materials, we have called your attention to the ecosystem of free, high-value, information that is available to people working with R. That is because this information is an important benefit of learning to use R.\n\nThis week we grow your capacity to find, and to use, the information you need.\nThis will help to build your independence for the work you will do in your future professional careers.\n\n\n9.3.1 Lectures\nThe lecture materials for this week are presented in four short parts.\nClick on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part.\n\nPart 1 (14 minutes) Data visualization perspectives and practices: The concepts and skills we will learn about in week 9: what we will learn and how we will know if we have learned it, the different kinds of goals we think about when we make visualizations, discovery and communication.\n\n\n\nPart 2 (8 minutes): the evidence base, the psychology of seeing and understanding visual information, and how we know what we should do in data visualization.\n\n\n\nPart 3 (19 minutes): why visualization is important, and why the things we can do to show variation and uncertainty matter, when we communicate evidence to audiences.\n\n\n\nPart 4 (25 minutes): the key skills — {ggplot2} as the grammar of graphics, why we have been working on building and editing plots step-by-step, what you can do in future work.\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Lecture slides\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the lecture slides\n\n\n\nThe slides presented in the videos can be downloaded here:\n\nThe slides exactly as presented (7 MB).\n\nYou can download the web page .html file and click on it to open it in any browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge or Safari). The slide images are high quality so the file is quite big and may take a few seconds to download.\n\n\nWe are going to work through some practical exercises, next, to develop your critical thinking and practical skills for working with linear models.\n\n\n9.4 Practical materials: data and R-Studio\nWe will work with two data files which you can download by clicking on their names (below):\n\nstudy-one-general-participants.csv.\nstudy-two-general-participants.csv.\n\nOnce you have downloaded the files, you will need to upload them to the R-Studio server to access and use the R files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nHere is a link to the sign-in page for R-Studio Server\n\n\n\n\n9.4.1 Practical materials guide\nAs usual, you will find that the practical exercises are simpler to do if you follow these steps in order.\n\nThe data — We will take a quick look at what is inside the data files so you know what everything means.\nThe how-to guide — We will go through the practical analysis and visualization coding steps, showing all the code required for each step.\nThe practical exercises — We will set out the tasks, questions and challenges that you should complete to learn the practical skills we target this week.\n\nThis week — Week 9 — our emphasis is on finding and making use of online information.\n\nThis work will enable you to find solutions for yourself in your professional working lives\nto figure out practical how and why answers to the questions you will face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 9 parts\n\n\n\n\nSet-up\nLoad the data\nRevision: locate and use {ggplot2} reference information.\nNew: locate and use tutorial or how-to information.\nNew: locate and use StackOverflow information.\n\n\n\nThere are three main sources of information you can access for free online:\n\nThe people who write software like the {tidyverse} or {ggplot2} libraries provide manuals, reference guides and tutorials. This information is often written as free web books.\nOther people write tutorials or guides or teaching materials designed to show learners (like us) how to use R functions or to do certain things using R. They may present these tutorials or guides as web books, blog sites or video tutorials, e.g., on Youtube or TikTok.\nMany people post questions and answers to discussion forums like Stackoverflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nLearning how to find, understand and use this information is important because:\n\nA lot of scholarly and technical information is online and free.\nBeing able to locate and to use this information is often the way that most professionals work out what they want to do, and how they can do it, if they have a problem or a question.\nThis means you get an advantage if you learn how to do that here.\n\n\n\n\n9.4.1.1 The data files\nEach of the data files we will work with has a similar structure.\nHere are what the first few rows in the

information\nWe have called your attention to {ggplot2} reference information before.\nThis time, we take you through the steps involved in exploiting this information efficiently to produce more plots that communicate more effectively.\n\nHow-to Task 5 – Find out how to produce layered boxplots to examine if vocabulary scores are different for people with different education levels\nYou have seen how to produce boxplots before, in previous classes (weeks 3 and 5): here we add a twist to make the plot dramatically more informative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA box plot is a visualization designed to enable you to visualize the distribution of scores on a numeric variable, sometimes so that you can compare the distribution of scores on that variable in different groups or conditions.\n\n\nThis task is both about finding out how to do things (generally), here, using {ggplot2} reference information, and also about finding out how to produce a particularly effective form of data visualization, combining summary estimates with raw data observations.\nWe can break this task into steps:\n\nFind relevant and useful information;\nLocate example code;\n\nRun the example code;\n\nEdit the code to do the task with the study.one.gen data.\n\nWe want to make a boxplot. You have done that before. But this time we want to make a plot that shows (i.) the summary statistics (median and quartile) information of the boxplot plus (ii.) the raw observation information about sample data values that you see in scatterplot points. That is because, in the lectures on data visualization, we learned about the ways in which summaries can sometimes obscure what is going on with the sample data (think of Anscombe’s Quartet).\nHow do we produce this kind of plot?\n\nA professional would take the wish-list of aims (i.) and (ii.) and start looking for information online to figure out how to produce the kind of plot they want.\n\nWe work through the steps in order:\n1. Find relevant and useful information\nYou find the information you need by doing keyword searches online:\n\nbut what are the keywords?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a search using the words: ggplot reference.\nThat will get you results including this one:\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/\n\n\n\nHow do you know if you can or should use the information you find?\n\nYou know the {ggplot2.tidyverse.org} information is ‘official’, relevant, and useful because you can see the hex badge (a hexagon shaped image): “ggplot2”.\n\nWe need more specific information on boxplots in the {ggplot2} library reference information:\n\nHow do we find it?\n\nYou can do a search of the reference index, or you can expand your set of keywords.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are looking specifically for information on box plots so do a search of the web page e.g. using CMD-F (on a Mac) or CTRL-F (on a PC) using the words: box or boxplot\nThat will get you a link – click on it:\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html\n\n\n\n2. Locate example code\nMost R developers design their information web pages in the same way:\n\nfirst, they show a list of arguments you can edit to make choices about how functions like geom_boxplot() work;\nsecond, they explain what the object – here, a boxplot – represents;\nthird, they may give you information about what information the function can work with;\nfourth, they give you example code \\(\\rightarrow\\) this is the bit you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nExample code can be run without reading in any extra data, once you have run:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nData referenced in the {tidyverse} help document examples will be available to use, pre-loaded.\n\n\nScroll through the page, looking for an example plot that looks like what we want: a plot which shows (i.) the summary statistics (median and quartile) information of the boxplot plus (ii.) the raw observation information (points) of the sample data.\n\nDo you see it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can see the example shown under this line of code.\n\np + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)\n\n\n\n3. Run the example code\nCopy the first bit of example code you see and paste it directly into the R-Studio Console and run it, or paste it into the Script window and run it:\n\nYou have to be careful. Read through the sequence of example code paying attention to each element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you run this line of code, you will get an error, at first.\n\np + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)\n\n\n\nThis is because the p + tells you that somewhere previously the sequence of examples builds a part of the plot p to which the next parts geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) are added.\n\nYou need to make sure you run the full sequence of example code to get the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you run this line of code, it will work.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy))\np + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sequence of code:\n\np &lt;- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) first constructs a plot object, called p – nothing will appear in the Plots window but the object p will appear in the Environment window in R-Studio.\np + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) adds the object geom_boxplot() to the object p – this step is where something is produced in the Plots window.\n+ geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) adds one plot on top of another.\n\nThis style of building a plot step-by-step enables you to construct quite complex plots, with multiple layers.\nIn the plot you can see that we get what we want. The plot shows:\n\nUsing geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) – a summary of the data, including the median (the thick line in the middle of each box) and the 25% and 75% quartiles (the lower and upper edges of the box) of the observed values for the variable hwy, for different groups of class.\nUsing geom_jitter(width = 0.2) – the raw observations (of hwy per class) that the boxplots summarize, shown as the black points superimposed on the boxplots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe example code from the {ggplot2} reference information demonstrates why we want to produce this kind of plot:\n\nWe can see that the boxplots, by their differing heights, show us the differences between groups in average outcomes (here, hwy, the y-axis variable).\nWe can also see that the points show us that showing just the boxes hides the fact that different groups (here, class of car) are associated with differences in samples (note the differences in the number or scatter of points).\n\n\n\n4. Edit the code to do the task with the study.one.gen data\nNow we know that we can produce the kind of plot we want, and we have seen the code that would produce that kind of plot.\nThe next step is to take the code structure that we see in the example and convert it so that kind of code does the same work for our own purposes.\nLet’s say that I want to produce a boxplot, showing raw data observations of accuracy of understanding, mean.acc, for each level of education in the study.one.gen data-set.\nHow do we convert the example code to produce the same kind of plot with our data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to change the data, and the aesthetic mappings – from this:\n\np &lt;- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy))\np + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)\n\n\nto this:\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = EDUCATION, y = mean.acc))\np + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)\n\nNotice:\n\nYou can write code quite concisely, like this ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) or more fully, like this ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)).\nYou change the dataset from the example mpg data to our data study.one.gen.\nWhen you construct a boxplot, x must be mapped = to a categorical variable: a nominal variable or factor like EDUCATION.\nWhen you construct a boxplot, y must be mapped =to a numeric variable: a continuous or interval variable like mean.acc.\ngeom_jitter(width = 0.2) is new: we add that to show the raw data observations.\n\n\n\n\nNow take a look at the plot we have made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data = study.one.gen, aes(x = EDUCATION, y = mean.acc))\np + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can make two useful observations:\n\nMean accuracy of understanding (of health information) is different in different education groups, on average – that is what the heights of the middle lines in the boxplots tell us.\nThe distribution of sample observations is really different for different education groups in this sample. This second observation might make us a bit uncertain about the extent to which the average outcome differences (comparing mean accuracy) reflect what we would see in the wider population.\n\nWhat are we learning here?\nThere are two lessons:\n\nIt is very useful to be able to find, read, and convert example code in online help information. Getting practice doing this will really helpful, not only to make it easier for you to do what we ask you to do but also for you to do things you decide you want to do.\n\n\nIn R, the plotting code is designed to work so that we can build complex plots, layer by later.\n\n\nIn general, it is helpful to be able to combine summaries with raw data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information you can explore\n\n\n\nYou can read more about boxplots here:\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html\nYou can read more about jittering here:\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.2.4 How-to Part 4: New – locate and use tutorial or how-to information\nThe official information provided by the developers of {ggplot2} or {tidyverse} are very useful but there is a whole other world of information — many hundreds of web-sites — provided by people interested in writing and sharing how-to guides and tutorials to highlight solutions to problems or answers to questions they, or others, have encountered.\n\nHow-to Task 6 – Find out how to modify the colour of the boxplots to examine if vocabulary scores are different for people with different education levels, and to distinguish education by colour\nThis time, we again want to produce some boxplots, but we want to modify the colours of the boxes to communicate information about the groups in our sample data to the reader.\n\nWe are using colour, here, not for decoration but as a third dimension of information, in addition to the height and the horizontal position of the boxes.\n\nHow do we change the colour of plot elements by linking colour differences to data differences?\nWe break this task into the same steps we followed before:\n\nFind relevant and useful information;\nLocate example code;\n\nRun the example code;\n\nEdit the code to do the task with the study.one.gen data.\n\n1. Find relevant and useful information\nAs before, we begin with a keyword search.\n\nWhat keywords do we need?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a search using the words: ggplot boxplot colour\nThat will get you results including this one:\nhttps://r-graph-gallery.com/264-control-ggplot2-boxplot-colors.html\n\n\n\nThe source you are looking for is not officially linked to the {ggplot} project so now you have to decide if it is useful: how do you do that?\nHint: You can decide simply if a source is useful by (1.) trying the example code (does it work?) and evaluating if you understand how it works (do you understand why it works?)\n2. Locate example code\nMost tutorial or how-to writers design their web pages in the same way:\n\nfirst, they identify what the question or problem is they are going to help you with;\nsecond, they explain what they will do;\nthird, they may give you example code \\(\\rightarrow\\) this is the bit you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nExample code is often highlighted – can you see it in the webpage?\nhttps://r-graph-gallery.com/264-control-ggplot2-boxplot-colors.html\n\n\n3. Run the example code\nHow do you this?\n\nUsually, tutorial writers tell you first what libraries you need to load, do that, then run their example code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy a chunk of example code and paste it directly into the Console and run it, or paste it into the Script window and run it:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x=class, y=hwy, fill=class)) + \n  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.3) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"BuPu\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sequence of code:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x=class, y=hwy, fill=class)) – tells R to map x to class to distinguish different groups by left-right position, and y to hwy to show outcome hwy scores by height. What is new here is this bit fill=class which tells R to colour the insides of the boxes with different colours for different classes.\ngeom_boxplot(alpha=0.3) + – tells R to draw boxplots, and reduce the opacity of the boxes (increase transparency).\ntheme(legend.position=\"none\") + – tells R to hide the legend.\nscale_fill_brewer(palette=\"BuPu\") – tells R to use the blue-purple Brewer colour palette to draw the colours.\n\n\n\n\nSo far, you have been using the default colour palette – sets of colours – that are built-in in R, or in {ggplot2} but there are many more palettes available.\n4. Edit the code to do the task with the study.one.gen data\nThe next step is to take the code structure that we see in the example and convert it so that kind of code does the same work for our own purposes.\nLet’s say that I want to produce a boxplot, showing the average accuracy of understanding, mean.acc, for each level of education in the study.one.gen data-set.\n\nThis will produce a set of boxplots. Each boxplot summarizes the mean.acc scores for a separate (education level) group. Now, I want to draw each boxplot in a different colour so different education levels are marked by different colours.\n\nHow do we convert the example code to produce the same kind of plot with our data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to change the data, and the aesthetic mappings – from this:\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x=class, y=hwy, fill=class)) + \n  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.3) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"BuPu\")\n\n\nto this:\n\n\nggplot(study.one.gen, aes(x=EDUCATION, y=mean.acc, fill=EDUCATION)) + \n  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.3) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"BuPu\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice:\n\nYou need to make sure that you copy a complete chunk of code:\n\n\nincluding ggplot()\nincluding aes()\nincluding geom_boxplot()\nincluding scale_fill_brewer()\n\n\nYou change the data-set name to study.one.gen and you change the x= and y= aesthetic mappings.\nTo change the colour of the boxplots, you add: fill=EDUCATION as an argument to the aesthetic mappings in aes(...)\nscale_fill_brewer() adds in the colour using the Brewer colour-blind friendly palette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow-to Task 7 – Can you find out more information about colour palettes?\nUsually, information about the availability of options for colour choices is organized in terms of palettes (like a set of colours in painting).\n\nWhat keywords do you need?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a search using the words:\n\nggplot colour palettes\nggplot colour blind friendly palettes\nggplot cookbook colour palettes\n\n\n\n\nResults may include:\nhttps://ggplot2-book.org/scales-colour\n\nor:\n\nhttp://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/#:~:text=(size%3D3)-,A%20colorblind%2Dfriendly%20palette,variable%2C%20then%20use%20it%20later\nThese sources are quite technical in places:\n\nCan you find useful example code?\n\nWhat are we learning here?\nYou have seen, previously, that it is quite straightforward to change the colours of things in plots.\nHere, we are learning that:\n\nyou can use colour to communicate key information about data;\nyou can choose colours deliberately to ensure accessibility (by using colour blind palettes) or to suit your tastes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information you can explore\n\n\n\nThere are several famous colour palettes that have been developed:\n\nViridis:\n\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html\n\nBrewer:\n\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html\n\nMetBrewer provides colour palettes matched to famous art works in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York:\n\nhttps://www.blakerobertmills.com/my-work/met-brewer\nAnd some people have contributed deep thinking about how and why we should different colour schemes in different contexts or for diverse audiences:\nhttps://personal.sron.nl/~pault/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMake intentional choices when you use colour!\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.2.5 How-to Part 5: New – locate and use StackOverflow information\nEverybody who uses R professionally uses StackOverflow all the time.\n\nIt is a huge, useful, resource of helpful information.\nMost of the time, if you do a search for answers to a question about using R – for data analysis, or plotting – the search will take you to a StackOverflow discussion page, sooner or later.\n\nLet’s learn how to use this resource.\n\nHow-to Task 7 – Find out how to export a nice boxplot so you can include it in a report\nIn writing a report, we often need to insert an image file.\n\nYou have been drawing some plots.\nNow, you need to save the plots so that you can use the plots in a report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPeople sometimes paste copies of screenshots of plots into reports. Sometimes, the plots look bad because they are low resolution, or because they are squashed into the wrong aspect ratio.\nThere is no need for this.\n\nYou can export or save the plot to an image file.\nYou can save the file in a high resolution.\nYou can make sure that the image has an aspect ratio that looks good.\n\n\n\nHow do you do this?\nWe break this task into the same steps we followed before:\n\nFind relevant and useful information;\nLocate example code;\n\nRun the example code;\n\nEdit the code to do the task with the study.one.gen data.\n\n1. Find relevant and useful information\nYou find the information you need by doing keyword searches online.\n\nWhat keywords do you need?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nDo a search using the words: how to export ggplot\n\n\nIf you use the right keywords, you should get to resources including this one:\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html\nThis is the official {ggplot2} library reference information on how to save plots.\nNotice:\n\nThis time, the example code at the end of the web page may not be helpful to everyone.\nThe usage information at the beginning tells you what you need to know but you will have to look up what arguments like device or dpi mean, and you will need to experiment a bit, trying different arguments, to get it to work for you.\n\nLet’s move on. We want something that is easy to use.\n\nHow do we find easy-to-use helpful information?\n\nOften, you are looking for a how-to guide of some kind.\n\nSo: what keywords do you need?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a search using the words: how to export ggplot\nThat will also get you results including this one:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/38907514/saving-a-high-resolution-image-in-r\nThis is what we want: the example code, you will find, is usable and it is clearly explained.\nNotice:\n\nOn StackOverflow, people posts questions and then other people post answers to those questions.\nStill others can up-vote or down-vote the questions and the answers.\nThis system means that the most interesting or useful questions are more likely to appear in your search results when you do searches with the right key words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn working with R: if you have a question someone has usually asked your question before, and someone else has usually posted an answer to that question.\n\nAs a rule: every question you ever have has been answered in a StackOverflow discussion.\n\nYou just need to be able to find that discussion, and to be able to use the answer information.\n\n\nIn the linked-to example, here, you can see that the discussion has been viewed 258k times (a lot).\n\nMany people have up-voted the question because it is so important.\nMany people have up-voted the answers to the question because they are so useful.\n\n2. Locate example code\nOn Stackoverflow, in response to any one question, different people may post alternative answers.\n\nSome students may be concerned that there is no one right answer.\nIn mathematics, there are right or wrong answers but this here is something different: we are working out how to do something with a computer.\nThe fact that there may be alternative different ways of doing the same task is a fair reflection of the reality that with the same set of tools\ndifferent experts can reasonably prefer different approaches or methods.\n\nHere, let’s just pick the simplest example:\n\ntiff(\"test.tiff\", units=\"in\", width=5, height=5, res=300)\n# insert ggplot code\ndev.off()\n\n3. Run the example code\nWhat happens if you run this example code?\n\ntiff(\"test.tiff\", units=\"in\", width=5, height=5, res=300)\n# insert ggplot code\ndev.off()\n\nNothing.\nNotice this bit: insert ggplot code.\nWe have to fix that.\n4. Edit the code to do the task with the study.one.gen data\nWhat the authors of the answer are telling you to do is to write your bit of code to produce a plot where they say: insert ggplot code.\nLet’s do that:\n\ntiff(\"my-plot.tiff\", units=\"in\", width=5, height=5, res=300)\n\nggplot(study.one.gen, aes(x=EDUCATION, y=SHIPLEY, fill=EDUCATION)) + \n  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.3) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"BuPu\")\n\ndev.off()\n\nquartz_off_screen \n                2 \n\n\nNotice:\n\nThis works but it may appear again as if nothing has happened.\nBut look in R-Studio in the Files window (bottom right screen).\nClick on the `Files’ tab.\nSort the list of files by date by clicking on the Modified column header.\nYou should see the file: my-plot.tiff in the Files space.\nYou can download this file by ticking the box.\n\nNow let’s go back to the way that the {ggplot2} library information recommends.\n\nTake a look at the second answer to the Stackoverflow question:\n\n\nggplot(data=df, aes(x=xvar, y=yvar)) + \ngeom_point()\n\nggsave(path = path, width = width, height = height, device='tiff', dpi=700)\n\nAdapt the example code to do the task:\n\nggplot(study.one.gen, aes(x=EDUCATION, y=SHIPLEY, fill=EDUCATION)) + \n  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.3) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"BuPu\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggsave(filename = 'my-plot-2.tiff', device='tiff', dpi=700)\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\nNow you should see:\n\nA plot appear in the Plots window in R-Studio.\nAnd a plot appear in the Files window in R-Studio.\n\nNotice:\n\nI deleted every argument I was not interested in using, e.g. width = ... and height = ...\nI gave the file a new name, so that you can see that this works as well as the dev.off() method\n\nWhich method do you prefer?\nWhat are we learning here?\nWe are learning two things:\n\nStackOverflow has many of the answers you will need, now, and later if you continue to use R.\nYou can save the image files you make for use in your reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information you can explore\n\n\n\nHere’s a blog post by Cedric Scherer:\nhttps://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/\n\nwhich covers many of the issues we have been discussing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3 The practical exercises\nNow you will progress through a series of tasks, and challenges, to test what you have learnt.\nWhat we want to do, here, is to ensure that you can access and use online information so that you can:\n\ndemonstrate you understand what you are doing when you find out how to do things;\nidentify your options when you assess the online information about coding or data analysis or plotting.\n\nGetting practice learning to do these things will help you generally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNow we will work with the data file\n\nstudy-two-general-participants.csv\n\n\n\nWe again split the steps into into parts, tasks and questions.\n\nSet-up\nLoad the data\nRevision: locate and use {ggplot2} reference information.\nNew: locate and use tutorial or how-to information.\nNew: locate and use Stackoverflow information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nThe how-to guide showed you ways of doing these tasks.\nNow use the hints and tips to complete the practical exercises that follow.\n\n\n\nWe are going to work through the following tasks, split into separate parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAn answers version of the workbook will be provided after the practical class.\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3.1 Practical Part 1: Set-up\nTo begin, we set up our environment in R.\n\nPractical Task 1 – Run code to empty the R environment\n\nrm(list=ls())\n\n\n\nPractical Task 2 – Run code to load relevant libraries\n\nlibrary(\"ggdist\")\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n\nYou may need to load other libraries as you progress.\nNotice, here, that we are using a library we have not used before: {ggdist}.\n\n\n\n9.4.3.2 Practical Part 2: Load the data\n\nPractical Task 3 – Read in the data file we will be using\nThe data file for the practical exercises is:\n\nstudy-two-general-participants.csv\n\nUse the read_csv() function to read the data file into R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstudy.two.gen &lt;- read_csv(\"study-two-general-participants.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nWhen you code this, you can choose your own file name, but be sure to give the data object you create a distinct name e.g. study.two.gen.\n\n\nPractical Task 4 – Inspect the data file\nUse the summary() function to take a look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary(study.two.gen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3.3 Practical Part 3: Revision – locate and use {ggplot2} reference information\n\nPractical Task 5 – Find out how to produce boxplots to examine if vocabulary scores are different for people with different education levels\nSpecifically, find out how to produce a plot comprising:\n\nboxplots showing a summary of vocabulary scores for people with different education levels;\nplus a scatterplot showing individual vocabulary scores for each person in the data-set.\n\nWe did this in the how-to guide: check it out before going on, if you are unsure.\n\nHere, we want to dig in to the information you find to show where you need to look, and what attention you need to invest, to understand the information you see.\n\nWe break this task into the same steps we followed before:\n\nFind relevant and useful information;\nLocate example code;\n\nRun the example code;\n\nEdit the code to do the task with the study.two.gen data.\n\n1. Find relevant and useful information\nHint: If you have never created a box plot before, a good place to start is the {ggplot2} library reference information.\n\nPract.Q.1. What keywords can you use to find the {ggplot2} library reference information?\n\n\nPract.A.1. You can do an effective search using the words: ggplot reference boxplot\n\nThat will get you results including this one:\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html\n\nYou know this source is official, relevant, and useful because you can see the hex badge: “ggplot2”.\n\n\nPract.Q.2. What does a boxplot represent? In other words, what summary statistics do the features of a boxplot display?\n\nHint: You need to search the reference information page for the key information about summary statistics.\n\nPract.A.2. The reference page includes this information:\n\n\nThe lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles). This differs slightly from the method used by the boxplot() function, and may be apparent with small samples. See boxplot.stats()for more information on how hinge positions are calculated for boxplot().\n\n\nThe upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 * IQR from the hinge (where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles).\n\n\nThe lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR of the hinge.\n\n\nData beyond the end of the whiskers are called “outlying” points and are plotted individually.\n\n2. Locate example code\n\nPract.Q.3. Can you find example code showing how to produce a boxplot that allows you to examine if vocabulary scores are different for people with different education levels, where different levels are shown in different colours?\n\n\nPract.A.3. The web page:\n\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html\n\nincludes example code like this, which shows you how to produce a boxplot:\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy))\np + geom_boxplot()\n\n\nalso which shows you how to add a scatterplot to a boxplot:\n\n\np + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)\n\n\nand also this, which shows you how to show different levels in different colours:\n\n\np + geom_boxplot(aes(colour = drv))\n\nNotice:\n\nCode chunk example (1.) shows you how to draw the basic plot, using information about variables class, hwy in data-set mpg.\nChunk (2.) shows you how to change the second line of chunk (1.) to get the boxplot \\(+\\) scatterplot we want.\nChunk (3.) presents code to vary colour by a variable but — warning — the variable is not the one you want to use, you want to replace drv with class.\nThis change is required because when you adapt the code you will want to colour the boxplots by the same variable that you use to split and arrange the data on the x-axis (EDUCATION).\nNote that you can put aesthetic mappings aes() inside geoms but, here, it would be neater to put all the aesthetic mappings together in one place, as shown following.\n\n3. Run the example code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nThe example code, when you put it together, and adapt it for your needs, will look like this:\n\np &lt;- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy, colour = class))\np + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe free online reference information is very helpful but it requires a bit of work to make use of it. This is natural, the authors of the information don’t know you and your situation.\n\nThis is what we are learning to do here.\n\n\n\nYou will need to understand two things before you move on.\n\nPract.Q.4. Can you explain what geom_jitter() does?\n\n\nPract.A.4. You can do a search like you have been doing – with the words: ggplot reference geom_jitter\n\nThat will get you results including this one:\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html\n\nwhich says:\n\n\nThe jitter geom is a convenient shortcut for geom_point(position = “jitter”). It adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point, and is a useful way of handling overplotting caused by discreteness in smaller datasets.\n\n\nPract.Q.5. Can you explain what “overplotting” means?\n\n\nPract.A.5. Overplotting refers to where points (or other objects) are printed on top of each other, or printed crowded together, making it difficult to identify different data elements\n\n4. Edit the code to do the task with the study.two.gen data\n\nPract.Q.6. Can you edit and run the example code to produce a complex plot comprising:\n\n\n\nboxplots showing a summary of vocabulary scores for people with different education levels;\n\n\n\n\nplus a scatterplot showing individual vocabulary scores for each person in the data-set;\n\n\n\n\nwith the boxes and the points representing vocabulary score data for different levels shown in different colours.\n\n\n\nPract.A.6. The example code can be edited to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data = study.two.gen, aes(x = EDUCATION, y = SHIPLEY, colour = EDUCATION))\np + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow look at the plot you have produced and critically evaluate it.\n\nPract.Q.7. What does the plot tell you about the average (median) vocabulary (SHIPLEY) score recorded for people in the study.two.gen data-set who report different education levels?\n\n\nPract.A.7. The plot indicates that the median vocabulary score is higher for people who report Higher education compared to people who report Further education or people who report Secondary education. We can see this because the middle line in the boxes, representing the median score for people in each education level group, is higher for for people who report Higher education.\n\n\nPract.Q.8. What does the plot tell you about the individual, i.e., per-person vocabulary (SHIPLEY) score recorded for people in the study.two.gen data-set who report different education levels?\n\n\nPract.A.8. The plot indicates a lot of variability in the individual scores. The distributions of scores appears to have similar wide ranges in each group.\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3.4 Practical Part 4: New – locate and use tutorial or how-to information\n\nPractical Task 6 – Find out how to construct a rain cloud plot\nWe can break this task into the usual steps:\n\nFind relevant and useful information;\nLocate example code;\n\nRun the example code;\n\nEdit the code to do the task with the study.two.gen data.\n\nRain cloud plots are now a popular visualization that incorporates elements of the boxplot, the scatterplot and the density plot to give the viewer summary information about the distribution of scores on a variable and also giving information about the variability of outcomes.\nWe work through the steps in order:\n1. Find relevant and useful information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can do an effective search using the words: how to ggplot rain cloud plot\n\n\n\nThat will get you results including these:\nhttps://www.cedricscherer.com/2021/06/06/visualizing-distributions-with-raincloud-plots-and-how-to-create-them-with-ggplot2/\n\nsee also:\n\nhttps://z3tt.github.io/Rainclouds/\nand\nhttps://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/07/ggdist-make-a-raincloud-plot-to-visualize-distribution-in-ggplot2/\nand\nhttps://rpubs.com/rana2hin/raincloud\nhttps://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-63\n\nPract.Q.9. There are reasons for doing the things we ask you to learn to do. Can you explain briefly why rain cloud plots are useful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople often explain why or how to do things in academic articles. A good source of information for the answer to this question is in the article by Allen et al. in wellcomeopenresearch.\n\n\n\n\nPract.A.9. The explanation, in short is that:\n\n\nconventional visualizations like bar plots can be misleading;\nshowing raw data with statistical summaries helps the viewer to see both statistical summary information and raw outcomes.\n\n2. Locate example code\nMost tutorial or how-to writers design their web pages in the same way:\n\nfirst, they identify what the question or problem is they are going to help you with;\nsecond, they explain what they will do;\nthird, they may give you example code \\(\\rightarrow\\) this is the bit you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou will find some tutorials easier to follow than others.\n\nPick the one that you can understand most easily.\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.10. Example code is often highlighted – can you see it in the webpage?\n\n\nPract.A.10. A good example tutorial is the one written by Cedric Scherer:\n\nhttps://www.cedricscherer.com/2021/06/06/visualizing-distributions-with-raincloud-plots-and-how-to-create-them-with-ggplot2/\nBut the example information is a bit simpler in another blog so I focus on this one:\nhttps://z3tt.github.io/Rainclouds/\n3. Run the example code\nHint: A long sequence of code chunks are required to explain rain cloud plots, so scroll through whatever tutorial you are looking at until you find the bit that is presented, e.g., as: Raincloud plots.\nCopy a chunk of example code and paste it directly into the Console and run it, or paste it into the Script window and run it:\n\nggplot(iris, aes(Species, Sepal.Width)) +\n   ggdist::stat_halfeye(adjust = .5, width = .7, .width = 0,\n                        justification = -.2, point_colour = NA) +\n   geom_boxplot(width = .2, outlier.shape = NA) +\n   geom_jitter(width = .05, alpha = .3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: Make sure you have copied the complete sequence of code shown in the highlighted window in the tutorial.\nHint: If you get a warning that a function is not available check that you have used library() to get all the libraries the tutorial authors said that you needed.\n4. Edit the code to do the task with the study.two.gen data\n\nPract.Q.11. Can you edit the example code to draw a rain cloud plot including:\n\n\nboxplots showing a summary of vocabulary scores for people with different education levels;\nplus a scatterplot showing individual vocabulary scores for each person in the data-set?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTo edit the example code to work for you, you will need to change the specification of the data-set and of the x = ... and y = ... aesthetic mappings in aes(...).\n\n\n\n\nPract.A.11. – You need to change the data, and the aesthetic mappings – from something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(iris, aes(Species, Sepal.Width)) +\n   ggdist::stat_halfeye(adjust = .5, width = .7, .width = 0,\n                        justification = -.2, point_colour = NA) +\n   geom_boxplot(width = .2, outlier.shape = NA) +\n   geom_jitter(width = .05, alpha = .3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = study.two.gen, aes(x = EDUCATION, y = SHIPLEY)) +\n   ggdist::stat_halfeye(adjust = .5, width = .7, .width = 0,\n                        justification = -.2, point_colour = NA) +\n   geom_boxplot(width = .2, outlier.shape = NA) +\n   geom_jitter(width = .05, alpha = .3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are we learning here?\nSometimes, when you are working with example code from an online source, you need to experiment a bit with the example code to get it to work.\n\nLearning to experiment with codd is a really useful skill to develop:\n\nYou can start by just deleting the arguments inside function calls, e.g., geom_boxplot(width = .2, outlier.shape = NA), one argument at a time, to see what changes.\nYou can then add arguments in, and change their values, to figure out what each argument adds.\n\nYou can’t break things in the world, in R, so you can experiment as much as you like through a process of trial-and-error.\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3.5 Practical Part 5: New – locate and use StackOverflow information\n\nPractical Task 7 – Export one of the nice plots you have been making so you can include it in a report\nIn the how-to guide you can find information on how to do this. Take a look and come back, if you need to.\nAdapt the example code to do the task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(iris, aes(Species, Sepal.Width)) +\n   ggdist::stat_halfeye(adjust = .5, width = .7, .width = 0,\n                        justification = -.2, point_colour = NA) +\n   geom_boxplot(width = .2, outlier.shape = NA) +\n   geom_jitter(width = .05, alpha = .3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ggsave(filename = 'my-plot-2.tiff', device='tiff', dpi=700)\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you should see:\n\nA plot appear in the ‘Plots’ window in R-Studio\nAnd a plot appear in the ‘Files’ window in R-Studio\n\nNotice:\n\nI gave the file a new name.\nI defined format using device='tiff' and resolution using dpi=700\n\nBut if you do not do these things, R will use (OK) defaults for you.\n\nPract.Q.12. Can you figure out how to insert the plot file you have created into a Word document?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can search for information on how to do this by using keywords like: word how to insert an image file\n\n\n\n\nPract.A.12. – You can find instructions e.g. here\n\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-pictures-3c51edf4-22e1-460a-b372-9329a8724344:~:text=Insert%20a%20picture%20in%20Word%2C%20PowerPoint%2C%20or%20Excel&text=On%20the%20Insert%20tab%2C%20click,in%20iPhoto%20or%20Photo%20Booth.\n\nPract.Q.13. Can you adapt the colour scheme of the plot to make it look good to you?\n\n\nPract.A.13. Again, we are asking you to do a key words search. If you do, the results may include:\n\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html\nYou may need to edit the aesthetic mappings to instruct R to map colour (lines) and fill to the categorical variable or factor we are working with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = study.two.gen, aes(x = EDUCATION, y = SHIPLEY,\n                             colour = EDUCATION, fill = EDUCATION)) +\n  ggdist::stat_halfeye(adjust = .5, width = .7, .width = 0, justification = -.2) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .2, outlier.shape = NA) +\n  geom_jitter(width = .05, alpha = .3) +\n  scale_colour_brewer() +\n  scale_fill_brewer()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.14. Can you change the theme?\n\n\nPract.A.14. Again, we are asking you to do a key words search. If you do, the results may include:\n\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html\n\nwhich provides information you can use to edit code as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = study.two.gen, aes(x = EDUCATION, y = SHIPLEY,\n                             colour = EDUCATION, fill = EDUCATION)) +\n  ggdist::stat_halfeye(adjust = .5, width = .7, .width = 0, justification = -.2) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .2, outlier.shape = NA) +\n  geom_jitter(width = .05, alpha = .3) +\n  scale_colour_brewer() +\n  scale_fill_brewer() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have now completed the Week 9 practical exercises and questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how you can produce informative, engaging, data visualizations is a key, highly employable, skill.\n\nBut understanding how visualizations are made also enables you to read plots when you see them.\nThis means that, whether you are doing data analysis, or consuming evidence from data analyses, this is an important step in your developmental journey: Well done!\n\nWe will continue to deepen and extend your skills and understanding but everything builds on the key lessons we have been learning here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answers\nAfter the practical class, we will reveal the answers that are currently hidden.\nThe answers version of the webpage will present my answers for questions, and some extra information where that is helpful.\n\n\nSummary\nYou start your work with these questions:\n\nWhat are our goals?\nWhat does our audience need or expect?\n\nYou develop your visualization in a reflective process:\n\nBegin with a quick draft to show the distributions or make the comparisons you think about first\nThen reflect, and edit: does this enable me to discover sources of variability in my data?\nThen reflect, and edit: does this enable me to effectively communicate what I want to communicate?\nThen reflect, and edit: does this look good? – do my viewers tell me this works well?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI can only show you the potential for creative and effective visualization\n\nexperiment and find what looks good and is useful to you\nseek out information – good places to start are:\n\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html\nhttps://r-graph-gallery.com",

    "text": "2.4 Practical Materials\n\n2.4.1 Workbook\nIn your group (or on your own until you’ve formed a group), work through this workbook, note any problems and questions you have, and come prepared to the online practical class to go through the tasks and ask your questions.\nIf you’ve done statistics using R-studio before then Parts 1 and 2 will be again largely revision for you. In this case, Part 3 is where you can focus your work.\nPart 1 of this workbook reproduces what you saw in the week 2 part 3 lecture.\nPart 2 gives you some more exercises in using R studio to revise last week’s material see this article for the psychology behind learning and memory effects of “spacing”.\nPart 3 provides you with more practice at looking at others’ data and manipulating it.\nPart 4 provides some more advanced methods for data manipulation.\nPart 5 looks at different ways that data is stored, and how to adjust that.\nPart 6 provides some extended extra practice in finding and investigating datasets.\nIf you have used R-studio before, then Part 6 will be where you will be developing some new advanced skills.\n\n2.4.1.1 Part One: repeat the steps from lecture 2 part 3\n\nTask Zero: making and opening an R script file\n\nOpen up the R server at https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk\nIn R studio, at the File menu, select New File, then R script.\nNow, we can put in our favourite sum to check it’s working.\nAt the top of the R script window type:\n\n\n10.5 + 7                        \n\nWith the cursor on the same line as the sum click on the Run button.\nIn the console, you should see the sum being run, and the answer produced.\n\nSave the R script.\n\nFirst of all, you can make a Directory/Folder to save the R scripts in to.\nYour file structure can be anything you like, but here’s how I organised it: At the bottom right panel of the R-studio window, click on Folder. Add a new Folder, call it, say PSYC411.\nClick on the PSYC411 Folder, and then make another new Folder, called, say “Week2”.\n\nThen, you can save this week’s workbook into the Week2 folder:\n\nClick on the Save icon just above the R script window, browse to the Folder where you want to save the script (e.g., PSYC411/Week2), then name the R script file (e.g., workbook_week2.r) and Save.\nThe .r subscript indicates to R studio that this is an R script file.\n\nClose the R script, by clicking on the little x next to the R script filename just above the R script window.\nNow open it again. In the R studio window File menu, select Open File, and browse to where you saved your R script file and open it.\nTo make it easier to save and open files we can set what is called the “working directory” for R studio. Click “Session” in the menu at the top of the R studio screen, select “Working directory”, then select “Choose directory”.\nBrowse to the Folder where you are going to save your PSYC411 R studio files (for me this is Documents/PSYC411), and click Open.\nOver on the right lower panel, you should now see all the files that are in this Folder - including psyc411_week2.r\n\n\n\nTask One: open and check Practical week1 workbook script file\n\nLast week, we didn’t save a script (as we were just using the console for R studio). But here’s one I prepared earlier… Download the week 1 script file here. This also has the answers (but you can check last week’s answers via the main Week 1 page already too).\n\nThis has now downloaded the file on to your local computer. You now need to make it available in the psy-rstudio system. To do this, we have to “Upload” the file.\nIn the bottom right panel of R studio, click “Upload”.\nFor the Target directory, select the Folder in R-studio that you’d like to upload the file to (e.g., PSYC411/Week1 - maybe first of all you’ll need to make the Folder).\nThen Browse to the file that is on your local computer, and click OK.\nYou should see it in the Files in the bottom right panel on R-studio.\n\nNow you can open psyc411_week1_workbook_answers.r in R-studio (either through File &gt; Open File, at the top left panel, or just by double-clicking it in the Files in the bottom right panel). You can now look through this R script, check your commands and answers to the tasks from last week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA really important feature to include in your r script are commments. Comments are preceded by a # which means that anything after the # on a line is not going to be interpreted as a command in R studio, but as a comment.\nGood comment style involves consistent use of # to indicate different sections (e.g., you can use multiples of #’s to partition different sections of the results and make it easy to navigate, i.e., ########), and clear and succinct statements about why the command is there and what it is doing - see examples in the script file.\nComments help us to keep track of what each bit of our r script is doing, and, also importantly, enable others to figure out what on earth it is that we’ve done so they can reproduce our analyses, and access our data more effectively, in the spirit of open science.\n\n\n\n\nTask Two: Opening a data file\n\nMake sure your script file psyc411_week2.r in R studio.\nIt’s generally a good idea to refresh and clear out R studio when you start a new session, so add this line to the beginning of your R studio file:\n\n\nrm(list=ls())                    \n\n\nNext we are going to open a new data file.\n\nDownload the file PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDO NOT OPEN THIS FILE ON YOUR COMPUTER – IF YOU DO, DELETE IT THEN DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN - THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT IT CHANGES THE FILE FORMAT AND THEN WON’T OPEN PROPERLY IN R STUDIO.\n\n\nThen, Upload the data file into R-Studio, and put it in PSYC411/Week2 Folder for instance.\nEach row is one person’s data, and each column is a measure taken from the person. Columns are separated by commas, which is what the “csv” refers to” comma-separated values.\n\nIn R studio, we open csv files using a function called read_csv() which comes from a set of functions that are stored in a library called “tidyverse”, we can install these functions by putting library(tidyverse) at the very top of our R script.\n\nType this command in the script file and then run it:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to know more about library()?\n\n\n\n\n\nR comes with certain functions pre-installed, such as mean(), but part of the charm of R is that we can install different functions that give us the opportunity to do almost anything! Collections of functions are called packages, and collections of packages are called libraries, but for the purpose of practicality, we typically refer to them interchangably. We install libraries using library() and enter the name of the library in the brackets.\n\n\n\n\nThen type this command in the script file and run it:\n\n\ndat &lt;- read_csv(\"PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv\")\n\nRemember the dat &lt;- notation, which means we put the data into an object called “dat”\n\nIf all went well, we can then look at the data, using the function View: In the script file type:\n\n\nView(dat)\n\nand run it. It should open a spreadsheet where we can see the data.\n\nHave a good look around the data to see if you can make sense of it. For now, we will just focus on two variables from the data: subject_ID which is the participants’ anonymised number, and Gent_1_score, which is the participants’ score on the Gent vocabulary test, the first time they had a go (that’s what the 1 stands for). We can just pick out the columns of data that we want using the select function.\n\nselect is in the library called “tidyverse”, so we don’t need to load this in again because we already have.\n\nsummarydat &lt;- select(dat, subject_ID, Gent_1_score)\n\n\nFinally, let’s just have a quick look at these data. In the script file type:\n\n\nhist(summarydat$Gent_1_score)\n\nand run it.\n\nThis will draw a histogram of the Gent vocabulary scores. summarydat$Gent_1_score means that we look at the Gent_1_score values from the summarydat data – the $ indicates that this is one of the measures from the data. What kind of pattern does the histogram show?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.1.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.1.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.1.1\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\ndat &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wk2/PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv\")\n\nRows: 81 Columns: 10\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): english_status, Gender, Dyslexia_diagnosis\ndbl (7): subject_ID, Age, Gender_code, Shipley_Voc_Score, Gent_1_score, Gent...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nsummarydat &lt;- select(dat, subject_ID, Gent_1_score)\nhist(summarydat$Gent_1_score)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks close to a normal distribution, slight negative skew possibly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1.2 Part Two: Revision from last week\n\nSave your R script. Now, without looking at your notes, make a new object called “iknow”, and assign this list of numbers to it: 126, 76, 98, 124, 91, 88, 99, 115, 80, 113, 90, 92, 97, 134, 110, 92, 92, 87, 135, 115\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nuse the iknow &lt;- c(number1, number2, …) notation\n\n\n\n\nRemember to type these commands in the R script window.

Now do the same for participantinfo.csv.\n\nThese data come from this study: Woodworth, R.J., O’Brien-Malone, A., Diamond, M.R. and Schüz, B., 2018. Data from, Web-based Positive Psychology Interventions: A Reexamination of Effectiveness. Journal of Open Psychology Data, 6(1).\nA brief description of the study is as follows: In our study we attempted a partial replication of the study of Seligman, Steen, Park, and Peterson (2005) which had suggested that the web-based delivery of positive psychology exercises could, as the consequence of containing specific, powerful therapeutic ingredients, effect greater increases in happiness and greater reductions in depression than could a placebo control. Participants (n=295) were randomly allocated to one of four intervention groups referred to, in accordance with the terminology in Seligman et al. (2005) as 1: Using Signature Strengths; 2: Three Good Things; 3: Gratitude Visit; 4: Early Memories (placebo control). At the commencement of the study, participants provided basic demongraphic information (age, sex, education, income) in addition to completing a pretest on the Authentic Happiness Inventory (AHI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Participants were asked to complete intervention-related activities during the week following the pretest. Futher measurements were then made on the AHI and CESD immediately after the intervention period (‘posttest’) and then 1 month after the posttest (day 38), 3 months after the posttest (day 98), and 6 months after the posttest (day 189). Participants were not able to to complete a follow-up questionnaire prior to the time that it was due but might have completed at either at the time that it was due, or later. We recorded the date and time at which follow-up questionnaires were completed.\n\nNext, load the data into R-studio.\n\nThe first file is data from participants’ self-ratings of happiness and depression.\nThe second contains demographic information about the participants. Type this in your R script:\n\ndat &lt;- read_csv(\"ahicesd.csv\")\npinfo &lt;- read_csv(\"participantinfo.csv\")\n\nrun this command (type Ctrl-Enter), then type\n\npinfo &lt;- read_csv(\"participantinfo.csv\")\n\nand run that.\nThis has made two new objects – one called “dat” which contains the experimental data, and one called “pinfo” which contains the demographic information.\n\n\nTask Four: Examining and manipulating data\n\nLet’s have a look at the data now.\n\n\nView(dat)\n\nRun this command, and you should see the data appear above the console window. Have a good long hard look at it.\n\nThe data contains:\n\nid which is the participant number;\noccasion which is whether this is the first (0), second (1), up to sixth (5) time they filled in the questionnaires;\nintervention is which intervention they took part in with respect to attempting to promote their mood;\nahi01-ahi24 are the 24 items on the AHI happiness scale;\ncesd01-cesd20 are the 20 items on the CESD depression scale.\nWay over on the right are the total scores on the AHI and the CESD questionnaires.\n\nNow, view the pinfo data. How can you look at it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndat &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wk2/ahicesd.csv\")\npinfo &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wk2/participantinfo.csv\")\nView(pinfo)\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the data replaced the source window, but the source is still there. Just above the View panel you should see a tab named psyc411_week2.r, click on that to get your source panel back. It will have a star/asterisk after the file name if it is unsaved. Remember it’s a good idea to regularly save your source file so you don’t lose work.\nNow, we are going to join together the two files. Type this:\n\n\nall_dat &lt;- inner_join(x = dat, y = pinfo, by = c('id', 'intervention'))\n\nQuestion: what does the c(“id”, “intervention”) bit mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means we match by two variables – id and intervention. We use the c() notation to indicate that this is a list of things.\n\n\n\nWe’ve now made a new data set called “all_dat”. The “x = dat” bit is the name of the first datafile we want to join, the “y = pinfo” is the name of the second datafile we want to join, the “by = ‘id’, ‘intervention’” bit is the names of variables that the two datasets have in common.\n\nHow would you join two data sets one called “data1” the other called “data2” together if they both have the variable “participantname” in common?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata_full &lt;- inner_join(x = data1, y = data2, by = c(\"participantname\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we just want to keep a few of the variables – we’re not interested in the individual questionnaire items. So, let’s select the variables we want to keep:\n\n\nsummarydata &lt;- select(all_dat, ahiTotal, cesdTotal, sex, age, educ, income, occasion, intervention)\n\nWhere “all_dat” is the name of the object to take data from, and “ahiTotal, cesdTotal, sex, age, educ, income, occasion, intervention” are all the variables we want to keep.\n\nHave a look at the summarydata in the View. How do you do that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView(summarydata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Five: Investigate data\n\nThe next task is to have a closer look at the distributions of the data. Let’s focus on the age of participants. To investigate one column of data from a dataset, you have to refer to it using the “$” symbol. So, to investigate the “age” column from the “summarydata” dataset, you would look at summarydata$age. Draw a histogram (bar graph) of the distribution of age in the participant sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist(summarydata$age)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s look at how the AHI and the CESD scores relate. To gain an impression of how two variables relate we can draw a scatter graph.\n\n\nplot(summarydata$ahiTotal, summarydata$cesdTotal)\n\nWhat does the “$” do in this command? What relationship do you find between these two variables?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n$ refers to one column in the data – either $ahiTotal or $cesdTotal columns.\nRelation is negative – higher happiness indicates lower depression.\n\n\n\n\nNow make sure you save psyc411_week2.r that contains all these commands that you ran. Close R studio, and Open R studio and make sure it’s saved all your work.\nThe list of commands is extremely useful for making science open and accessible to other researchers. It’s more and more common for psychology articles to make the R source files available so other researchers can reproduce the data manipulations and analyses used in the paper precisely.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.4 Part Four: More (advanced) data manipulation\n\nFor reading in more types of data, you can use commands other than read_csv(). Have a look at https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/218611977-Importing-Data-with-RStudio and have a go at loading in excel files or text files with various formats into R studio, remember last week, we also loaded in spss .sav files using the spss.get() function in the Hmisc library.\n\nAnother way to load in spss .sav files is to use the library called haven and the function read_sav which then works quite similarly to the read_csv file.\nNote that using lots of different resources online is one of the points of using R-studio – everything is open and shared. It isn’t cheating - it’s what everyone who uses R-studio does, it’s what I did when I was checking some of the commands in this module - so do use google (or baidu, or any search engine) to explore other commands, and to get hints if you ever get stuck.\n\nWhat if the datafiles you wanted to combine together had different names for participants – maybe, for instance, in datafile “dataone” it’s called “id” and in “datatwo” it’s called “participant”. You can do this by specifying how variables in different datasets relate to each other.\n\nTake a look at the help information for inner_join by typing ?inner_join then in the help pane on the right, scroll down to find the section titled “Arguments”, and read what it has to say about the argument “by”. See if you can understand how to join these files together. The examples at the bottom of the help section may be useful too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe important help information is: “To join by different variables on x and y, use a named vector. For example, by = c(”a” = “b”) will match x$a to y$b.”\n\ndata_full &lt;- inner_join(x = dataone, y = datatwo, by = c(\"id\" = \"participant\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the data set from Woodworth et al., we might want to just look at the pretests. We can use a function called filter to pull out just some of the rows.\n\n\nsummarydata_occasion0 &lt;- filter(summarydata, occasion == 0)\n\nThis pulls out just the first occasion of testing (the pretest).\nHow would you pull out the second occasion of testing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilter(summarydata, occasion == 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would you pull out just those participants who had the first intervention from the summarydata data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilter(summarydata, intervention == 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to the data set with just occasion == 0 selected. Now plot the relationship between the AHI and CESD scores at this pretest. What is the pattern now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nstill the same\n\nplot(summarydata_occasion0$ahiTotal, summarydata_occasion0$cesdTotal)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow about just the participants who had intervention 1. What is the relationship between their scores on the AHI and CESD in the first test?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\ncan do this in two ways:\n\nsummarydata_occasion0_intervention1 &lt;- filter(summarydata, occasion == 0 & intervention == 1)\nplot(summarydata_occasion0_intervention1$ahiTotal, summarydata_occasion0_intervention1$cesdTotal)\n\nor\n\nsummarydata_occasion0_intervention1 &lt;- filter(summarydata_occasion0, intervention == 1)\nplot(summarydata_occasion0$ahiTotal, summarydata_occasion0$cesdTotal)\n\nThe relationship is still similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3.5 Part Five: Different ways in which data are stored: long and wide data format\nWhen we look at other people’s data sets there are two generic ways in which they can be presented. The first is called “wide format”, and this is when several measures are presented on a single row in the data. This is the format of the data in the vocabulary scores: psyc411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv, where there are three vocabulary tests each in different columns. The other format is called “long format”, and this is where each observation is on a different line – and if there is more than one observation from the same subject then that subject has multiple lines in the data. There are some functions in the tidyverse library that helps us convert from wide to long and long to wide. This part practises these conversions.\n\nTask Six: Wide to long format conversion\n\nLet’s go back to the psyc411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv data. This should still be in the object called “dat”. If it’s not, then load the data again into dat, using the read_csv() function.\nMake sure the library(tidyverse) is loaded, if not, run the command library(tidyverse).\nThe aim here is to convert the data so that each Gent vocabulary score is on a separate line, we use the pivot_longer function for this. First we specify what the new object should be (datlong), then we say where the old data is (dat), then we make a new variable to keep the names of the tests (names_to = “test”), then we make a new variable to keep the scores from the tests (values_to = “vocab”), then we specify the list of old variables to combine into the new scores variable (c(“Gent_1_score”, “Gent_2_score”) ) – remember lists are written as c(). So, run this command:\n\n\ndatlong &lt;- pivot_longer(dat, names_to = \"test\", values_to = \"vocab\", cols = c(\"Gent_1_score\", \"Gent_2_score\")) \n\n\nHave a look at the new object datlong that results: View(datlong). This function pivot_longer has taken as input the data in dat, it has created a new variable called “test” which reports whether it is the Gent_1_score or the Gent_2_score that is the measurement, and a new variable called “vocab” where the actual scores are listed. Then, the following list of variables let’s the function pivot_longer know which variables from the object dat we are converting (or lengthening). It also includes all the other variables, but unconverted. How many rows of data are there now corresponding to data from subject_ID number 1?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nLet’s tidy things up so we only have subject_ID, and the Gent vocabulary scores by using select:\n\n\ndatlongsummary &lt;- select(datlong, subject_ID, test, vocab)\n\n\n\nTask Seven: Long to wide format conversion\n\nNow, we will have a go at converting from long to wide format. Let’s start with the datlongsummary object. We will convert this so that Gent_1_score and Gent_2_score are listed alongside each other – one row per person. The command for this is the reverse of pivot_longer, called pivot_wider. Run this command:\n\n\ndatwide &lt;- pivot_wider(datlongsummary, names_from = \"test\", values_from = \"vocab\")\n\nThis command takes the data from datlongsummary and puts the different measures reported in the variable test into different columns again, filling in the values from the variable vocab.\n\n\n\n4.1.3.6 Part Six: Extra practice finding and interpreting data sets\nThis part involves you exploring online psychology articles and finding an article which has made its data set available. More and more journals require data to be available when articles are published, an influential journal that has supported open science practices is Psychological Science. Go to the webpage of Psychological Science: https://journals.sagepub.com/home/pss. Browse the journal (you can view it on campus, off campus might be more difficult). Articles which have a dataset available have a “badge” indicating open data.\nIf data is made available, it is usually present as a “Supplemental Material” or via a link in the article (often data is stored on sites such as Open Science Framework (osf.io) or Figshare). For example, for this article:\nat the end of the article there is a note on how to access the data:\nYour task is to: download an article, download its data, and be able to describe what is in the data – i.e., what the rows and the columns in the data refer to. You can do this individually or as a group. At the next practical, you will talk one of the demonstrators through your description of the data.\nYou are free to explore the journal in its entirety to find an article that interests you, but some data sets can be really complicated to interpret. Some that you might begin with are as follows:\nvon Hippel, W., Ronay, R., Baker, E., Kjelsaas, K., & Murphy, S. C. (2016). Quick thinkers are smooth talkers: Mental speed facilitates charisma. Psychological Science, 27(1), 119-122. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797615616255\ndata is available on osf.io (open science foundation) have a look in the Archive of OSF Storage for this article, under “Clean Data”, “Study 1 data long format.csv”. See if you can figure that one out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two things to be aware of with data.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, real life data, just like real life, is usually not complete – it contains missing values. The usual way to indicate missing values is “NA” in R. But if the data set contains missing values indicated in a different way, then you have to specify this when you input the data. So, if missing values are indicated by “999”, you have to do it like this:\n\nread_csv(\"file.csv\", na.strings=\"999\")\n\nwhere file.csv is the file you are inputting. If missing values are indicated by “na”, you have to do this:\n\nread_csv(\"file.csv\", na.strings=\"na\")\n\nif missing values are “.”, then like this:\n\nread_csv(\"file.csv\", na.strings=\".\")\n\nThe second thing you might need to know is how to input files other than comma separated files. For excel files, you need to do this: library(readxl), then you can use the command read_excel(\"file.xls\"), this should work for xls and xlsx files. For inputting data that is in text, but not separated by commas, have a look at the help for the read_csv() function: ?read_csv. Hint – you’ll be looking to change the sep option for the read_csv command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if I can’t upload a file into the r server?\n\n\n\nSometimes, very annoyingly, a file is too large to upload into the r server.\nThis isn’t a problem if you have r studio installed on your own computer, but using the server it is rather annoying.\nIf the data is stored online somewhere, then if you can find the web address for the data file then you can upload it directly in the following way:\nHere is an example on osf:\nThis is from the study Wald, K. A., Abraham, M., Pike, B., & Galinsky, A. D. (2024). Gender Differences in Climbing up the Ladder: Why Experience Closes the Ambition Gender Gap. Psychological Science, in press. and the data is here on osf\nNavigate to the actual data file in osf, in this case we go to OSF storage, then Study 1, then data, then the file gender_study1_cleaned_data.csv.\nClick on the file, then on the next screen click on the three dots that are next to the file name, then right-click on Download and copy the link. This is the web address for the data file gender_study1_cleaned_data.csv\nThen, paste this into the read_csv command, and load it directly into an object in r studio, i.e.:\ndat &lt;- read_csv('https://osf.io/download/zstxk/?view_only=e7257f621e7c4b50b4032efd667d0db1')\nImportantly, you need to use single quotation marks ’, either side of the web address.\n\n\n\nSee if you can find and load the data from any (or all) of these studies. Then have a go at exploring the data - e.g., can you first of all recreate the numbers in the paper (e.g., age and number of participants, mean and sd of the main dependent variable?)\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Data\nHere are links to all the data referred to in this practical:\n\nPSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv\nahicesd.csv\nparticipantinfo.csv\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Answers\nThe answers to the workbook now appear below each question in the workbook, above, so you can check your answers.\nIt’s really important for your learning that you have a go first of all at the workbook before looking at the answers.\n\n\n2.5 Extras\n\nOptionally, watch Brian Nosek’s keynote at the 2018 British Psychological Society conference on the replicability crisis (note hosted on youtube).",

Download the data from here: PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_24.csv and read the data into an object in R studio called vdat (for vocabulary data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.1.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.1.1\n\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.1.1\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nvdat &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wk4/PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_24.csv\")\n\nRows: 270 Columns: 8\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (2): english_status, Gender\ndbl (6): subject_ID, Age, Shipley_Voc_Score, Gent_1_score, Gent_2_score, aca...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, when we want to look at a particular variable (a column) in an object in R studio, we refer to it using the $ notation. So, for the object vdat and the variable academic_year you would refer to it as vdat$academic_year. For this data set, we need to change academic year to be a nominal (factor) variable. Why are we setting academic year to be nominal and not interval/ratio?:\n\n\nvdat$academic_year &lt;- as.factor(vdat$academic_year)\n\nview(vdat) #view the data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has to be nominal unless we have a hypothesis about the order of years of groups being important to the data. But that is very unlikely to have an effect (though you could look up the “Flynn Effect” in case you wanted to generate one…). But for now we want each year to be treated independently, rather than in order, in our analysis.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the tidyverse library is loaded. Select all the variables apart from Age and save as a new object called “summaryvdat”. We will omit these variables because they are not complete for the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# there are two ways to do this, either list the variables you are omitting with a `-c(variables,variables,...)` command:\nsummaryvdat &lt;- select(vdat, -c(Age))\n\n# or list the variables we do want to include:\nsummaryvdat &lt;- select(vdat, subject_ID, english_status, Gender, Shipley_Voc_Score, Gent_1_score, Gent_2_score, academic_year)\n\n\n\n\n\nArrange the data according to Gent_2_score, from highest to lowest.

If you need to download these again, you can get them here: ahicesd.csv, participantinfo.csv.\n\n\nRemember these data come from this study: Woodworth, R.J., O’Brien-Malone, A., Diamond, M.R. and Schuz, B. (2018). Data from, “Web-based Positive Psychology Interventions: A Reexamination of Effectiveness”. Journal of Open Psychology Data, 6(1).\nRemind yourself of the aim of the study and the variables that are in the data set (see end of this script file for repeat description on the study).\n\n\nNext, load and join the ahicesd.csv and participantinfo.csv data in R studio. Call the joined data set “all_dat” (see week 2 workbook for reminders about this)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndat &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wk2/ahicesd.csv\")\n\nRows: 992 Columns: 50\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (50): id, occasion, elapsed.days, intervention, ahi01, ahi02, ahi03, ahi...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\npinfo &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wk2/participantinfo.csv\")\n\nRows: 295 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (6): id, intervention, sex, age, educ, income\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nall_dat &lt;- inner_join(x = dat, y = pinfo, by = c(\"id\", \"intervention\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Selecting and manipulating data\n\nWe’re not interested in the individual questionnaire items. So, let’s select all the variables we want to keep (omitting the individual questionnaire items), and save this to an object called summary_all_dat (again see week 2 workbook for reminder)\nNext, we will add another variable to the data. We use the function mutate() for this. Let’s scale the ahiTotal and cesdTotal values and add them to the summary_all_dat set.\n\n\nWhat are the minimum and maximum values of the new variable ahiTotalscale?\nWhat do these scale values mean? (reminder: they are Z scores).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nhint: use the arrange() function, or the min() and max() functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary_all_dat &lt;- select(all_dat, c(\"id\", \"occasion\", \"intervention\", \"ahiTotal\",\"cesdTotal\",\"sex\", \"age\", \"educ\", \"income\"))\nsummary_all_dat_scale &lt;- mutate(summary_all_dat, ahiTotalscale = scale(ahiTotal),\n                                cesdTotalscale = scale(cesdTotal))\nsummarise(summary_all_dat_scale, min(ahiTotalscale), max(ahiTotalscale))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  `min(ahiTotalscale)` `max(ahiTotalscale)`\n                 &lt;dbl&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1                -2.87                 2.90\n\n\nThe values are z-scores so the numbers indicate how many standard deviations the values are from the mean\n\n\n\n\nThe next way we will work with the data is to organise the observations into different groups. We will use the function summarise(). So, instead of mean(summary_all_dat_scale$ahiTotal) you can use this, which turns out to be a much more powerful way of looking at the data:\n\n\nsummarise(summary_all_dat_scale, mean(ahiTotal))\n\n\nThey should give the same results - check that they do. This function summarise() is more powerful because you can look at several values at the same time, e.g.:\n\n\nsummarise(summary_all_dat_scale, mean(ahiTotal), sd(ahiTotal), mean(cesdTotal), sd(cesdTotal))\n\n\nWhat is the result of this command?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummarise(summary_all_dat_scale, mean(ahiTotal), sd(ahiTotal), \n          mean(cesdTotal), sd(cesdTotal))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  `mean(ahiTotal)` `sd(ahiTotal)` `mean(cesdTotal)` `sd(cesdTotal)`\n             &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1             72.8           14.2              13.1            11.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now let’s think about what kind of patterns we’d like to investigate in the data. There are four interventions conducted in this study. Let’s look at each of these interventions and their effect of ahiTotal and cesdTotal.\n\nWe can look at subgroups of data either by using the filter() function, or by using the function group_by(). The advantage of group_by() is that we can look at several groups at the same time, rather than dividing up the data file into pieces. Let’s organise by the different interventions.\n\nsummary_all_dat_scale_intervention &lt;- group_by(summary_all_dat_scale, intervention)\n\n\nThis command takes the data summary_all_dat_scale, and then groups it according to the four interventions in the data. We can’t yet see any difference in summary_all_dat_scale_intervention but it’s in there, lurking, just waiting.\n\nNow, we can look at the means for each intervention using the summarise function again. Run the summarise function on summarydata_scale_intervention. What happens?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummarise(summary_all_dat_scale, mean(ahiTotal), sd(ahiTotal), \n          mean(cesdTotal), sd(cesdTotal))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  `mean(ahiTotal)` `sd(ahiTotal)` `mean(cesdTotal)` `sd(cesdTotal)`\n             &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1             72.8           14.2              13.1            11.7\n\n\nIt separates out the means and SDs by the group_by condition - i.e, by intervention.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also group by several factors at the same time. We can group by intervention and get means and standard deviations, but that is not going to give us a huge amount of insight into how the interventions affect the happiness measure because we are combining the mean of ahiTotal across all occasions of testing, including testing before the intervention has been applied.\n\nSo, let’s group by intervention and occasion of testing:\n\nsummary_all_dat_intocc &lt;- group_by(summary_all_dat_scale, intervention, occasion)\n\n\nNow produce the means and standard deviations of the happiness score (ahiTotal) for each intervention at each testing occasion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary_all_dat_intocc &lt;- group_by(summary_all_dat_scale, intervention, occasion)\nsummarise(summary_all_dat_intocc, mean(ahiTotal), sd(ahiTotal))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'intervention'.

Download the titanic data.\n\nRead the titanic.csv into an object called “titanic”.\nView the data. It should correspond to the data in the overhead slides.\n\nMake a bar graph to count the numbers of survived and died by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitanic &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wk4/titanic.csv\")\n\nNew names:\nRows: 1309 Columns: 3\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(2): class, survival dbl (1): ...1\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -&gt; `...1`\n\nggplot(titanic, aes(x = class, fill = survival)) + \n  geom_bar( position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s see if there is a significant relation between class and survival using Chi-squared:\n\n\nchisq.test(x = titanic$class, y = titanic$survival)\n\n\nThe results give the chi-squared value, the number of degrees of freedom, and the p-value. P = 2.2e-16 means p = .0000000000000022. That’s highly significant. That means the observations are divided across the categories in a way that is very unlikely to be due to chance (for this number (P = 2.2e-16), it means there’s a 2 in a quadrillion chance that titanic survival was not related to class).\n\nIn a report, you would write:\nChi-squared(2, N= 1309) = 127.86, p &lt; .001.\n\nTo understand where the significant effect comes from, we need to look at where in our table of counts there is a big discrepancy between the expected frequency and the actual frequency. We can do this by analysing the “standardised residuals” of the chi-squared test.\n\nRepeat the chi-squared test on the titanic data set, and save the result of the test into a new object called “titanic_chisq_result”.\nThen, look at the standardised residuals that are saved in the test results - the standardised residuals are saved in a variable called stdres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is how you do it\n\ntitanic_chisq_result &lt;- chisq.test(x = titanic$class, y = titanic$survival)\ntitanic_chisq_result$stdres\n\n             titanic$survival\ntitanic$class       died   survived\n       first  -10.110480  10.110480\n       second  -1.837589   1.837589\n       third   10.254442 -10.254442\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative values indicate that actual counts are lower than expected, positive values indicate that actual counts are higher than expected. The standardised residuals indicate that there are fewer first class and more third class than expected that died, second class died at a level close to that expected from the overall numbers of deaths.\n\nNow, let’s compute Cramer’s V. First, we need to make sure we have the library lsr loaded in.\n\n\nlibrary(lsr)\n\n\nThen run the test:\n\n\ncramersV(x = titanic$class, y = titanic$survival)\n\n\nYour next task is to run some Chi-squared and Cramer’s V tests on some of the other nominal data. Open the data “PSYC411-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_24.csv” again.

Data available here\nDescription of their study:\nIn our study we attempted a partial replication of the study of Seligman, Steen, Park, and Peterson (2005) which had suggested that the web-based delivery of positive psychology exercises could, as the consequence of containing specific, powerful therapeutic ingredients, effect greater increases in happiness and greater reductions in depression than could a placebo control. Participants (n=295) were randomly allocated to one of four intervention groups referred to, in accordance with the terminology in Seligman et al. (2005) as 1: Using Signature Strengths; 2: Three Good Things; 3: Gratitude Visit; 4: Early Memories (placebo control). At the commencement of the study, participants provided basic demographic information (age, sex, education, income) in addition to completing a pretest on the Authentic Happiness Inventory (AHI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Participants were asked to complete intervention-related activities during the week following the pretest. Futher measurements were then made on the AHI and CESD immediately after the intervention period (‘posttest’) and then 1 month after the posttest (day 38), 3 months after the posttest (day 98), and 6 months after the posttest (day 189). Participants were not able to to complete a follow-up questionnaire prior to the time that it was due but might have completed at either at the time that it was due, or later. We recorded the date and time at which follow-up questionnaires were completed.",

    "text": "In this chapter, we shall start to develop skills in using a method or approach that is essential in modern data analysis: multilevel modeling. We are going to invest four weeks in working on this approach. This investment is designed to give you a specific, important, advantage in your work as a psychologist, or as someone who produces or consumes psychological research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMultilevel models: why do we need to do this? - Four weeks is a lot of time to spend on one method.\n\n\nIt is now clear that someone who works in psychological research has to know about multilevel or hierarchically structured data, and has to know how to apply multilevel models (or mixed-effects models). Growth in the popularity of these kinds of analysis has been very very rapid, as can be seen in Figure 1. It is now, effectively, the standard or default method for professional data analysis in most areas of psychological and other social or clinical sciences (or it soon will be). There are good reasons for this (Baayen et al., 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of Pubmed citations for ‘Linear Mixed Models’ by year. Generated using the tool available at http://dan.corlan.net/medline-trend.html, entering “Linear Mixed Models” as the phrase search term and using data from 2000 to 2018, from Meteyard and Davies (2020) – used without permission\n\n\n\nWe continue to teach ANOVA and multiple regression (linear models) in our courses because the research literature is full of the results of analyses done using these methods and because many psychologists continue to use these methods in their research. However, there is increasingly wide-spread recognition that these classical methods have serious problems when applied to data with hierarchical structure. Because most psychological data (not all) will have hierarchical structure, this makes learning about multilevel or mixed-effects methods a key learning objective.\nBut, because it is relatively new, many professional psychologists struggle to understand why or how to use these methods effectively. This means that students who acquire the skill graduate with a clear employability advantage. It also means that we have to take seriously the challenge of learning about these methods. This is why we will spend a bit of time on them. In my experience, in over a decade of teaching multilevel models, in working with both students and professionals, we shall need to develop understanding and skills gradually. We will work patiently, so that we can secure understanding by building our learning through a series of practical examples, increasing the scope of our practical skills, and developing the sophistication of our understanding, step-by-step, as we go.\n\n\nMultilevel models are also known as hierarchical models or linear mixed-effects models or random effects models. People use these terms interchangeably. They also use the abbreviations LMMs or LMEs. Sorry about that: humans make methods, and the names we use for things do vary.\nI will only use the terms multilevel or linear mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\nIn this chapter, we emphasize the multilevel perspective but, to anticipate future development, we will come to think in terms of mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key challenges for learning should be explained at the start so that we know what we shall have to do to overcome them.\n\nEven though most psychological data has some sort of multilevel or hierarchical structure, we are not used to recognizing it. This is because the structure has often been hidden or ignored in the education and practice of traditional research methods in Psychology.\n\nIn time, you will come to see multilevel structure everywhere (Kreft & Leeuw, 1998). But first you will need to get some practice so that you can become familiar with the idea and learn to recognize what it looks like when data have a multilevel or hierarchical structure. This is why we will examine multilevel structured data across a range of different kinds of experiments or surveys, over a series of weeks.\nWe will learn to identify and understand hierarchical structure in psychological data by just looking at datasets, by producing visualizations, by doing analyses, and by trying to explain to ourselves and each other what we think we see.\n\nThe ideas that support an understanding of why and how we use multilevel models can be intimidating when we first encounter them. The mathematics behind how the models work is both profound and sophisticated. But the good news is that we can practice the application of the analysis method while talking and thinking about the critical ideas using just words or plots.\n\nWe cannot or should not avoid engaging with the ideas – because we have to be able to explain what we are doing – but there are many routes to an effective understanding. For those who want to develop a more mathematically-based perspective, I will provide references to important texts in the literature on multilevel models (see Section 1.11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMultilevel models are a general form of linear model.\n\n\nAnother way of saying this is: linear models are a special form of multilevel models.\nThis is because linear models assume that observations are independent. We often cannot make this assumption, as we shall see. More generally, then, we do not assume that observations are independent and so we use multilevel models.\n\n\n\nWe are not going to take a mathematical approach to learning about multilevel models. We do not have to. The approach we are going to take is:\n\nverbal – We will talk about the main ideas in words. Sometimes, we will present formulas but that is just to save having to use too many words.\nvisual – We will show ourselves and each other what multilevel structure in data looks like, and what that structure means for our analyses of behaviour.\npractical – We will use R to complete analyses, so we will learn about coding models in practice. Fortunately, through coding we can get a clear idea of what we want the models to do.\n\n\n\n\nOur learning objectives include the development of key concepts and skills.\n\nconcepts – how data can have multilevel structures and what this requires in models\nskills – where skills comprise the capacity to:\n\n\nuse visualization to examine observations within groups\nrun linear models over all data and within each class\nuse the lmer() function to fit models of multilevel data\n\nWe are just getting started. Our plan will be to build depth and breadth in understanding as we progress over the next few weeks.\n\n\n\nI have provided a collection of materials you can use. Here, I explain what they are and how I suggest you use them.\n1. Video recordings of lectures\n1.1. I have recorded a lecture in three parts. The lectures should be accessible by anyone who has the link.\n\nPart 1 – about 16 minutes\nPart 2 – about 13 minutes\nPart 3 – about 13 minutes\n\n1.2. I suggest you watch the recordings then read the rest of this chapter.\n\nThe lectures provide a summary of the main points.\n\n1.3. You can download the lecture slides in three different versions:\n\n402-week-17-LME-1.pdf: high resolution .pdf, exactly as delivered [4 MB];\n402-week-17-LME-1_1pp.pdf: low resolution .pdf, printable version, one-slide-per-page [359 KB];\n402-week-17-LME-1_6pp.pdf: low resolution .pdf, printable version, six-slides-per-page [359 KB].\n\nThe high resolution version is the version delivered for the lecture recordings. Because the images are produced to be high resolution, the file size is quite big (4 MB) so, to make the slides easier to download, I produced low resolution versions: 1pp and 6pp. These should be easier to download and print out if that is what you want to do.\n2. Chapter: 01-multilevel\n2.1. I have written this chapter to discuss the main ideas and set out the practical steps you can follow to start to develop the skills required to analyse multilevel structured data.\n2.2. The practical elements include data tidying, visualization and analysis steps.\n2.3. You can read the chapter, see in the chapter how to run the code, and do the exercises.\n\nRead in the example data BAFACALO_DATASET.RData and identify how the data are structured at multiple levels.\nUse visualizations to explore the impact of the structure.\nRun analyses using linear models (revision) and linear mixed-effects models (extension) code.\nReview the recommended readings (Section 1.11).\n\n3. Practical materials\n3.1 In the following sections, I describe the practical steps, and associated practical materials (exercise workbooks and data), you can use for your learning.\n\n\n\nIn this chapter, we will be working with data taken from a study on education outcomes in Brazilian children, reported by Golino & Gomes (2014). First, we will progress through the steps required to download and prepare the files for analysis in R.\nThe BAFACALO_DATASET.RData data were collected and shared online by Golino & Gomes (2014). Information about the background motivating the study, the methods of data collection, along with the dataset itself, can be found here.\nGolino & Gomes (2014) collected school end-of-year subject grades for a sample of 292 children recruited from multiple classes in a school in Brazil. Here, each subject is a theme or course that children studied in school, e.g., Physics or English language, and for which each child was awarded a grade at the end of the school year. So, we have information on different children, and information about their subject grades. Children were taught in different classes but the classes appear to be units of the school organization (the information is not quite clear) not subject or course groupings. Thus, we also have information on which classes children were in when data about them were collected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the data: get the data file and the .R script you can use to do the exercises that will support your learning.\n\nYou can download the files folder for this chapter by clicking on the link 01-multilevel.zip.\n\n\n\nThe practical materials folder includes:\n\nBAFACALO_DATASET.RData\n402-01-multilevel-workbook.R the workbook you will need to do the practical exercises.\n\nThe data file is in the .RData format: .RData is R’s own file format so the code you use to load and access the data for analysis is a bit simpler than you are used to, see Section 1.7.2 next. (You will have used read.csv() or read_csv() previously.)\nIn my own practice, I prefer to keep files in formats like .csv which can be opened and read in other software applications (like Excel), so using an .RData is an exception in these materials.\nYou can also access the data from the link associated with the Golino & Gomes (2014) article here.\n\n\n\nDuring practical sessions, each week, you can use the workbook to prompt your code construction and your thinking, with support.\nAfter practical sessions, you will be able to download an answers version of the workbook .R so check back here after the session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the answers: get the data file and the .R script with answers.\n\n\n\nThe link to this folder will not be provided until after a session has finished.\nWhen the link is live, you will be able to download a folder including:\n\n402-01-multilevel-workbook-with-answers.R with answers to questions and example code for doing the exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read the BAFACALO_DATASET.RData file into the R workspace or environment using the following code.\n\nload(\"BAFACALO_DATASET.RData\")\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset consists of rows and columns. Take a look. If you have successfully loaded the dataset into the R environment, then you should be able to view it.\nYou could look at the dataset by using the View() function.\n\nView(BAFACALO_DATASET)\n\nOr you can use the head() function to see the top few rows of the dataset.\n\nhead(BAFACALO_DATASET)\n\nYou can check for yourself that each row holds data about a child, including their participant identity code, as well as information about their parents, household, gender, age, school class, and their grades on end-of-year subject attainment (e.g., how well they did in English language).\nThere are many more variables in the dataset than we need for our exercises, and a summary would fill pages. You can see for yourself if you inspect the dataset using\n\nsummary(BAFACALO_DATASET)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you inspect the file, you will see that it includes a large number of variables, but we only really care about those we will use in our exercises:\n\nparticipant_id gives the participant identity code for each child;\nclass_number gives the class identity code for the school class for each child;\nand values in portuguese, english, math, and physics columns give the score for each child in subject class attainment measures.\n\nYou can see that I am not explaining the variables in great depth. For our aims, we do not need more detailed information but please do read the data article if you wish to find out more.\nWe need to tidy the data before we can get to the analysis parts of this chapter. We are going to:\n\nSelect the variables we want to work with;\nFilter out missing values, if any are present;\nAnd make sure R knows how we want each variable to be identified; what type the variable should have.\n\nWe shall need the tidyverse library of functions.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\nWe can start by selecting the variables we want, which include those named here, ignoring all the rest. We take the BAFACALO_DATASET. We then use the select() function to select the variables we want.\n\nbrazil &lt;- BAFACALO_DATASET %&gt;%\n                    select(\n                      class_number, participant_id,\n                      portuguese, english, math, physics\n                      )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice the code is written to create the new selected dataset and, at the same time, gave it a more usable (shorter) name, with brazil &lt;- BAFACALO_DATASET ...\n\n\nInspect the data to see what you have.\n\nsummary(brazil)\n\n  class_number participant_id     portuguese     english         math    \n M11    : 21   Min.   :  1.00   60     : 10   100    : 17   60     : 13  \n M15    : 20   1st Qu.: 73.75   76     :  9   79     : 11   69     :  9  \n M14    : 19   Median :146.50   65     :  8   96     :  8   70     :  9  \n M36    : 19   Mean   :146.50   73     :  8   81     :  7   62     :  8  \n M18    : 18   3rd Qu.:219.25   74     :  7   89     :  7   71     :  7  \n (Other):133   Max.   :292.00   (Other):188   (Other):180   (Other):184  \n NA's   : 62                    NA's   : 62   NA's   : 62   NA's   : 62  \n    physics   \n 60     : 16  \n 60.1   :  5  \n 0      :  4  \n 61.8   :  4  \n 66     :  4  \n (Other):197  \n NA's   : 62  \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you look at the results of the selection, you can see that there are missing values, written as e.g. NA's 62 at the bottom of each summary of each variable (if a variable column includes missing values).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemember that in R NA means “not available” i.e. missing.\n\n\nWe will need to get rid of the missing values. It is simpler to do this at the start rather than wait for an error message, later, when some arithmetic function tells us it cannot give us a result because there are NAs present.\nWe can get rid of the missing values using na.omit()\n\nbrazil &lt;- na.omit(brazil)\n\nIf you then look at a summary of the data again then you will see that the NAs are gone.\n\nsummary(brazil)\n\n  class_number participant_id    portuguese     english         math    \n M11    : 21   Min.   :  3.0   60     : 10   100    : 17   60     : 13  \n M15    : 20   1st Qu.: 77.5   76     :  9   79     : 11   69     :  9  \n M14    : 19   Median :144.5   65     :  8   96     :  8   70     :  9  \n M36    : 19   Mean   :146.6   73     :  8   81     :  7   62     :  8  \n M18    : 18   3rd Qu.:222.8   74     :  7   89     :  7   71     :  7  \n M21    : 17   Max.   :291.0   82     :  7   86     :  6   66     :  6  \n (Other):116                   (Other):181   (Other):174   (Other):178  \n    physics   \n 60     : 16  \n 60.1   :  5  \n 0      :  4  \n 61.8   :  4  \n 66     :  4  \n 74.2   :  4  \n (Other):193  \n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you look closely at the output from summary(brazil) you will see that the portuguese and english variables are summarized in the way that R summarizes factors.\nWhen you ask R to summarize factors, R gives you a count of the number of observations associated with each factor level, that is, each category in each variable. Here, it is treating a grade score like \\(100\\) in english as a category (like you might treat \\(dog\\) as a category of pets), and you can see that the count shows you that 17 children were recorded as having scored 100 in their class. We do not want numeric variables like subject grades (e.g. children’s grades in English) treated as categorical variables, factors.\nYou can also see that R gives you a numeric summary of the recorded values in the participant_id variable. This makes no sense because the identity code numbers are (presumably) assigned at random so identity numbers provide no useful numeric information for us. We do not want this either.\nWe want R to treat the educational attainment scores as numbers. We can do this using the as.numeric() function. We want R to treat the class and participant identity numbers as factors (categorical variables).

A vector can be understood to be a set or list of elements: things like numbers of words.\nR gives each vector a type (factor, numeric etc.) which helps to inform different functions how to handle that vector. Usually, R assigns type correctly but sometimes it does not. We can use what is called coercion to force R to assign the correct type to a variable.\nIt is more efficient to do this at the start of an analysis workflow.\nNormally, I would use read_csv() from tidyverse and assign type to variable using col_types() specification. (See here for more information and an example.) But it is useful to learn what you need to do if you need to change the way a variable is treated after you have got the data into the R environment.\n\n\n\nIn R, there are a family of functions that work together. You can test whether a variable (a vector, technically) is or is not a certain type using the is.[something] function. For example:\n\nis.factor(brazil$english)\nis.numeric(brazil$english)\nis.character(brazil$english)\n\nAnd you can coerce variables so that they are treated as having certain types.\n\nbrazil$english &lt;- as.factor(brazil$english)\nbrazil$english &lt;- as.numeric(brazil$english)\nbrazil$english &lt;- as.character(brazil$english)\n\nNow try it out.\n\nTest out type for different variables using is...() for some of the variables.\nTest out coercion – and its results – using as...() for some of the variables.\nLook at the results using summary().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe (Psychologists) often adopt Repeated Measures or Clustered designs in our studies, and these designs yield data that have a multilevel structure. Examples of research which results in data with a multilevel structure include:\n\nStudies where we test the same people multiple times, maybe in developmental or longitudinal investigations;\nIntervention, learning or treatment studies where we need to make pre- and post-treatment comparisons;\nStudies where we present multiple stimuli and everyone sees the same stimuli;\nStudies that involve multi-stage sampling e.g. selecting a sample of classes or schools then testing a sample of children within each classes or within each school.\n\nThe key insight to keep in mind when considering the analysis of such data is that observations are clustered and are not independent: they are correlated. What is correlated with what?\nImagine testing a number of subjects by giving them all the same test. In that test, you might present them all with the same stimuli over a series of trials, so that everybody sees the same set of stimuli. Do you think an observed response recorded for any one individual will be uncorrelated i.e. independent of that person’s other responses?\nPeople are different and one usually finds that a slow or inaccurate subject is slow or inaccurate for most of their responses. That means that if you have information about one of their responses you can predict, in part, what the time or accuracy of one of their other responses would be. That capacity to predict one response from another is what we mean when we talk about a lack of independence.\nAlternatively, imagine going to test children in a school. Will the children in one class be more like each other than they are like children in other classes? In other words, is there an effect of class – maybe due to the approach of the teacher, the effect of the class environment etc. – so that outcomes for children in a class are correlated with each other?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe are talking, here, about a really quite general property of data collected in certain, very widely used, designs in Psychology: the clustering or hierarchical ordering of data.\n\n\nThis week, we will see that we must deal with the dependence of observations within a class, where the observed responses were made about the different pupils tested in a class, for a number of different classes.\n\n\n\nThe utility of multilevel models to analyze multilevel data or hierarchically structured data is well established in education. In educational research, we often need to think about effects of interventions or correlations in the context of observing children in classes, schools or districts, perhaps over time or at different time points. This means that many of the critical textbooks present examples that are based on educational research data (Goldstein, 1995; Kreft & Leeuw, 1998; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Snijders & Bosker, 2004).\nMultilevel models are growing in popularity in Psychology as well as in Education because they can be used to account for systematic and random sources of variance in observed outcomes when data are hierarchically structured. A hierarchical structure is present in data when a researcher: tests participants who belong to different groups like classes, clinics or schools; presents a sample of stimuli to each member of a sample of participants; or makes repeated observations for each participant over a series of test occasions.\nIn these circumstances, the application of traditional analytic methods has typically required the researcher to aggregate their data (e.g., averaging the responses made by a participant to different stimuli) or to ignore the hierarchical structure in their data, (e.g., analyzing the responses made by some pupils while ignoring the fact that the pupils were tested in different classes). But the application of traditional analysis approaches (e.g., regression, ANOVA) to multilevel structured data extracts scientific costs (Baayen et al., 2008; Barr et al., 2013).\nIgnoring structure by ignoring or averaging over sources of variability like differences between classes, participants, or stimulus items can mean that analyses are less sensitive because they fail to fully account for error variance. Where differences between classes, participants or stimuli include variation in the impact of experimental variables, e.g., individual differences in response to an experimental manipulation, the application of traditional methods can be associated with an increased risk of false positives in discovery. Yet these costs need no longer be suffered because the capacity to perform multilevel modeling is now readily accessible.\n\n\n\nIf a researcher tests participants belonging to different groups, e.g., records the educational attainment of different children recruited from different classes in a school, the test scores for the participants are observations that occupy the lowest level of a hierarchy (see Figure 2). In multilevel modeling, those observations are understood to be nested within higher-level sampling units, here, the classes. We can say that the children are sampled from the population of children. And the classes are sampled from the population of classes. Critically, we recognize that the children’s test scores are nested within the classes. This multi-stage sampling has important consequences, as we shall see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nA\n\nA\n\n\n\nB1\n\nB1\n\n\n\nA-&gt;B1\n\n\n\n\n\nB2\n\nB2\n\n\n\nA-&gt;B2\n\n\n\n\n\nC1\n\nC1\n\n\n\nB1-&gt;C1\n\n\n\n\n\nC2\n\nC2\n\n\n\nB1-&gt;C2\n\n\n\n\n\nC3\n\nC3\n\n\n\nB1-&gt;C3\n\n\n\n\n\nC4\n\nC4\n\n\n\nB2-&gt;C4\n\n\n\n\n\nC5\n\nC5\n\n\n\nB2-&gt;C5\n\n\n\n\n\nC6\n\nC6\n\n\n\nB2-&gt;C6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Multilevel or hierarchically structured data\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are going to be working with the school data collected by Golino & Gomes (2014) in Brazil, so let’s take another look at that dataset. The data extract, following, presents the first 25 rows of the selected-variables brazil dataset. (I have arranged the rows by class number ID, and you may need to make sure the browser window is wide enough to see the data properly.) If you examine the extract, you can see that there are multiple rows of data for each class_number, one row for each child, with multiple children (you can see different participant_id numbers). This presentation of the dataset illustrates in practical terms – what you can actually see when you look at your data – what multilevel structured data can look like.\n\nbrazil %&gt;%\n       arrange(desc(class_number)) %&gt;%\n                 head(n = 25)\n\n   class_number participant_id portuguese english math physics\n1           M36             11         80      55   60      81\n2           M36             30         48      55   43      57\n3           M36             93         83      75   55      80\n4           M36             95         80      66   55      66\n5           M36            111         80      57   99     129\n6           M36            117         27      76   83      89\n7           M36            153          2      66   89     141\n8           M36            163         68      88   74     137\n9           M36            176         80      75   60     127\n10          M36            216         75      79   64     124\n11          M36            223         81      56   58      78\n12          M36            234         81      75   49      74\n13          M36            242         81      67   45      77\n14          M36            254         76      51   33     103\n15          M36            260         81      59   39      82\n16          M36            271         64      69   82     138\n17          M36            278         80      57   56     107\n18          M36            280         83      64   56      84\n19          M36            286         80      91   64      98\n20          M35             20         42      61   97      92\n21          M35            118         33      59   33      80\n22          M35            140         28      40   33      58\n23          M35            179         38      69   56     145\n24          M35            247         65      51   64      97\n25          M33             15         76      70   73      85\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognizing that the children’s scores data are observed within classes means that, when we examine the factors that influence variance in observed outcomes, we need to take into account the fact that the children can be grouped by (or under) the class they were in when their grades were recorded. We can develop an understanding of what this means by moving through a series of steps.\nTo illustrate the understanding we need to develop, we analyze the end-of-year school subject grades for the sample of 292 children studied by Golino & Gomes (2014). With these data, we can examine whether differences between children in their Portuguese language grades predicts differences in their English language grades. (We do not have a theoretical reason to make this prediction though it does not seem unreasonable.) Let’s make this our research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: Does Portuguese grade predict English grade?\n\n\n\nNow, the first step we take in our development of understanding will be to first ignore the importance of the potential differences between classes.\nWe can begin our analysis in order to address the research question by plotting the possible association between Portuguese and English grades. We shall create a scatterplot to do this, and we create the plot by running the following code and ignoring group (class) membership. In the following chunk of code, I pipe the brazil data using %&gt;% to ggplot() and then create the plot step-by-step, with each ggplot() step separated by a + except for the last step.\n\nbrazil %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = portuguese, y = english)) +\n  geom_point(colour = \"black\", size = 3, alpha = .5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", size = 2, se = FALSE, colour = \"red\") +\n  xlab(\"Portuguese\") + ylab(\"English\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Portuguese compared to English grades: each point represents the scores for one child\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that each child ID is associated with a pair of grades: their grade in English and their grade in Portuguese. Each point in Figure 3 represents the paired grade data for one child.\nBecause I say that we are interested in predicting English grades then, by convention, we map English grades to the height of the points (i.e. English grade differences are shown as differences on the y-axis). Because we are using Portuguese grades to do the predicting, by convention, we map Portuguese grades to the horizontal position of the points (i.e. Portuguese grade differences are shown as differences on the x-axis).\nI have added a line using geom_smooth() in red to indicate the trend of the potential association between variation in Portuguese grades and variation in English grades.\nFigure 3 suggests that children with higher grades in Portuguese tend, on average, to also have higher grades in English.\n\n\nNotice that when we write the code to produce the plot, we add arguments to the geom_point() and geom_smooth() function calls to adjust the appearance of the points and the smoother line. Notice, also, that we adjust the labels for the x-axis and y-axis and, finally, that we determine the overall appearance of the plot using the theme_bw() function call.\nDo the following exercises to practice your ggplot() skills\n\nChange the x and y variables to math and physics\nChange the theme from theme_bw() to something different\nChange the appearance of the points, try different colours, shapes or sizes.\n\nFurther information to help you try out coding options can be found here, on scatterplots, and here, on themes.\n\n\n\n\nOur plot indicates the relationship between English and Portuguese language grades, in Figure 3, ignoring the fact that children in the sample belonged to different classes when they were tested. The plot shows us only information about the children and grades, with each point representing the observed English and Portuguese grades for each \\(i\\) child.\nCan we predict variation in English grades given information about child Portuguese grades? Are English grades related to Portuguese grades? We can estimate the relationship between English and Portuguese grades using a linear model in which the English grades variable is the outcome variable (or the dependent variable) and the Portuguese grades variable is the predictor or independent variable:\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + e_i\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(y_i\\) represents the English grade for each \\(i\\) child;\n\\(\\beta_0\\) represents the intercept, the outcome value obtained if values of the explanatory variable are zero;\n\\(\\beta_1\\) represents the effect of variation in \\(X_i\\) the Portuguese grade for each child, with the effect of that variation estimated as the the rate of change in English grade for unit change in Portuguese grade;\n\\(e_i\\) represents differences, for each child, between the observed English grade and the English grade predicted by the relationship with Portuguese grades.\n\nAs you have seen, the code for running a linear model corresponds transparently to the statistical model given in the formula.\n\nsummary(lm(english ~ portuguese, data = brazil))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = english ~ portuguese, data = brazil)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-64.909 -17.573   2.782  20.042  53.292 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

R^2 = .13\\)). So, we have a preliminary answer to our research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: Does Portuguese grade predict English grade?\nResult: Our analysis shows that children who score one grade higher in their Portuguese class (e.g., 61 compared to 60) tended to score .47 of a grade higher in their English class.\n\n\n\nWe shall see that we will need to revise this estimate when we do an analysis that does take school class differences into account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice: here, I have dispensed with the creation of a model object by name. The model is estimated anyway, and I have embedded the lm() function call within a summary() function so that I am asking R to do two things:\n\nlm() fit a linear model\nsummary() print out a summary of the fitted model object\n\nI do this to give an example of the way in which code can be varied. Also, to show you how one function can be embedded inside another.\n\n\n\n\nDo the following exercises to practice your lm() skills\n\nChange the outcome and predictor variables to math and physics\nWhat do the results tell you about the relationship between maths and physics ability?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following discussion, I will present some model formulas as equations. I am not doing that because the discussion is going to consider the modeling in terms of the underlying mathematics. I am doing it with the aim of clarifying how quantities – observed, estimated or predicted – add up, in terms of the linear and then the linear mixed-effects model.\n\nI am going to refer to the dependent or outcome variable (e.g., school grade) as \\(y\\),\nand to explanatory or experimental or independent variables (e.g., language skill) as \\(X\\).\nModels shall be fitted to estimate the coefficients, written \\(\\beta\\), of the effects of the explanatory variables on the outcome variable\nTo distinguish the different coefficients of the different effects, I am going to number the coefficients so …\n\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) is the coefficient of the intercept;\n\\(\\beta_1\\) will be the coefficient of the effect of a first explanatory variable: in the Brazilian schools example, the coefficient of the effect of variation in Portuguese language skill on variation in English language scores.\n\nTo make it clear that each observation can be understood as part of a complex multilevel or crossed random effects structure, I am going to use indices as subscripts for variables.\n\nI will, here, index individual participants (children) using \\(i\\);\nI will index index classes in which children were tested using \\(j\\).\n\nThus, in the Brazilian schools example, we shall see that we are concerned with observations about children’s school grades, where children are sampled as individuals nested in samples of classes. We will examine how an outcome variable (English language grade) is related to a predictor variable (Portuguese language grade) such that:\n\n\\(y_{ij}\\) is the outcome English language grade recorded for each child \\(i\\) in each class \\(j\\);\nwhile \\(X_{ij}\\) represents the explanatory variable, see following, the Portuguese language grade.\n\n\\(X_{ij}\\) is subscripted \\(_{ij}\\) because values of the variable depend upon child identity, and children are identified as child \\(i\\) in class \\(j\\) to represent the multilevel structure of the data\n\n\n\nThe linear model ignores the higher-level structure, the distinction between classes: does this matter?\nWe can see the answer to that question if we inspect Figure 4. We create the plot using the following chunk of code; we discuss that later, first reflecting on what the plot shows us.\n\nbrazil %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = portuguese, y = english)) +\ngeom_point(colour = \"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, colour = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ class_number) +\n  xlab(\"Portuguese\") + ylab(\"English\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(25,50,75)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,50,100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot of child grades, comparing English with Portuguese grades, shown separately for each school class\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 presents a grid of scatterplots, with a different scatterplot to show the relationship between children’s Portuguese and English grades for the children in each different class. We can see that the relationship between Portuguese and English grades is (roughly) similar across classes: in general, children with higher Portuguese grades also tend to have higher English grades. However, Figure 4 makes it obvious that there are important differences between classes.\nWe can see that the slope of the best fit line (shown in black) varies between classes. And we can see that the intercept (where the line meets the y-axis) also varies between classes. Further, we can see that in some classes, there is no relationship or a negative relationship between Portuguese and English grades.\nCritically, we can see that classes differ in how much data we have for each. For some classes, we have many observations (e.g., M11) and for other classes we have few or one observation (e.g., M22, with one child). We know, in advance, that variation in sample size will be associated with variation in the uncertainty we have about the estimated relationship between Portuguese and English grades. You will remember that the Central Limit Theorem allows us to calculate the standard error of an estimate like the mean, given the sample size, and that the standard error is an index of our uncertainty of the estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFacetting – notice that, in the plotting code, the key expression is facet_wrap(~ class_number) This means:\n\nThe class_number variable is a factor: we ask R to check the summary for the dataframe, and that factor codes what class a child is in.\nThe facet_wrap(...) function then asks R to produce separate plots for each facet for the data – the word facet means face or aspect.\nWe use the formula facet_wrap(~ ...) to ask R to split the data up by using the classification information in the named variable, here class_number.\n\n\n\nThe production of a grid or lattice of plots is a useful method for comparing patterns between data sub-sets or groups. You can see more information about facet_wrap() here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAdjusting scales – notice that in these plots I modified the axes to show x-axis and y-axis ticks at specific locations using scale functions. The tick is the notch or short line where we show the numbers on the axes.\n\nscale_x_continuous(breaks=c(25,50,75)) means: set the x-axis ticks at 25, 50 and 75, defined using a vector c() of values\nscale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,50,100)) means: set the y-axis ticks at 0, 50, 100, defined using a vector of values.\n\n\n\nIt can be useful to adjust the ticks on axes, where other plot production factors cause crowding of labels.\nYou can see more information on scales here.\n\n\nDo the following exercises to practice your facet_wrap() skills\n\nChange the x and y variables to math and physics.\nExperiment with showing the differences between classes in a different way: instead of using facet_wrap() in aes() add colour = class_number: what happens?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows that there is variation between classes in both the average English grade, shown as differences in the y-axis intercept, and the ‘effect’ of Portuguese language skill, shown as differences in the slope of the best fit line for the predicted relationship between Portuguese and English grades.\nWe put ‘effect’ in quotes to signal the fact that we do not wish to assert a causal relation. The interpretation of the results of the linear model assumes those results are valid provided that the observations are independent, among other things. We can see that we cannot make the assumption of independence because individuals in classes with high average English grades are more likely to have higher English grades.\nWe can represent in our analysis the information we have about hierarchical structure in the data (child within class) by allowing the regression coefficients to vary between groups. We therefore modify the subscripting to take into account the fact that we must distinguish which child \\(i\\) and which class \\(j\\) we are examining, adapting our model to:\n\\[\ny_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j}X_{ij} + e_{ij}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(y_{ij}\\) represents the outcome measure, the English grade for each \\(i\\) child in each \\(j\\) class;\n\\(\\beta_{0j}\\) represents the average grade, different in different classes;\n\\(\\beta_{1j}X_{ij}\\) represents the variation in \\(X\\) the Portuguese grade for each \\(i\\) child in \\(j\\) class, with the effect of that variation estimated as the coefficient \\(\\beta_{1j}\\), different in different classes;\nand \\(e_{ij}\\) represents differences between observed and predicted English grades for each \\(i\\) child in \\(j\\) class.\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, we could capture the variation between classes by performing a two-step analysis.\n\nFirst, we estimate the coefficient of the ‘Portuguese’ effect for each class separately. We do multiple (per-class) analyses. In each of these analyses, we estimate the coefficient looking only at the data for one class.\nSecond, we can take those per-class coefficients as the outcome variable in a ‘slopes-as-outcomes analysis’ to examine if the per-class estimates of the experimental effect are reliably different from zero or, more usefully, if the per-class estimates vary in relation to some explanatory variable like teacher skill.\n\nThe problem with the approach is apparent in Figure 5: the figure shows the estimated intercept and coefficient of the slope of the ‘Portuguese’ effect for each class, when we have analyzed the data for each class in a separate linear model.\nThe estimate for each class is shown as a black dot. The standard error of the estimate is shown as a black vertical line, shown above and below a point.\nYou can say that where there is a longer line there we have more uncertainty about the location of the estimate. Notice that the standard errors vary a lot between classes. In some classes, the standard error is small (the black line is short) so we can maybe have more certainty over the estimated intercept or slope for those classes. In other classes, the standard error is large (the black line is long) so we can maybe have less certainty over the estimated intercept or slope for those classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe key idea here is that standard errors vary widely between classes but the two-step modeling approach, while it can take into account the between-class differences in estimates, cannot account for the variation in the standard errors about those estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Plot showing the estimated intercept and coefficient of the slope of the Portuguese effect for each class analysed separately\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that the code I used fits a separate model for each class, and then plots the per-class estimates of intercepts and slopes of the english ~ portuguese relationship.\n\n\n(In case you want to see how this plot is produced, I work through the code for drawing Figure 5 in the workbook .R.)\n\n\nThe ‘slopes-as-outcomes’ approach is quite common and can be found in a number of papers in the psychological and educational research literatures. An influential example can be found in the report by Balota et al. (2004) of their analysis of psycholinguistic effects in older and younger adults. Balota et al. (2004) wanted to examine if or how effects of variables like word frequency, on reading response latencies, were different in different age groups. To do this, they first estimated the effect of the (word-level) psycholinguistic variables in separate linear model (multple regressions) for each adult. They then took the estimated coefficients as the dependent variable (slopes-as-outcomes) for a second analysis in which they tested the effect of age group on variation in the estimated coefficients (see Lorch & Myers (1990) for a discussion of the approach).\nYou may be asked to do this. I would advise you against it because there is a better way, as we see next.\n\n\n\n\nMultilevel models incorporate estimates of the intercept and the effect of independent (experimental or correlational) variables plus estimates of the random variation between classes in intercepts and slopes. Multilevel models are also known as mixed-effects models because they involve the estimation of fixed effects (effects due to independent variables) and random effects (effects due to random differences between groups).\nWe model the intercept (varying between classes) as:\n\\[\n\\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_0 + U_{0j}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\beta_{0j}\\) values equal \\(\\gamma_0\\) the overall average intercept,\nplus \\(U_{0j}\\) the differences, for each class, between that average intercept and the intercept for that class.\n\nWe model the coefficient of the (Portuguese language) skill effect as:\n\\[\n\\beta_{1j} = \\gamma_1 + U_{1j}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\beta_{1j}\\) values equal \\(\\gamma_1\\) the average slope,\nplus \\(U_{1j}\\) the differences, for each class, between that average slope and the slope for that class.\n\nThese models can then be combined:\n\\[\ny_{ij} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1X_{ij} + U_{0j} + U_{1j}X_{ij} + e_{ij}\n\\]\nsuch that the English grade observed for each child \\(y_{ij}\\) can be predicted given:\n\nthe average grade overall \\(\\gamma_0\\) plus\nthe average relationship between English and Portuguese language skills \\(\\gamma_1\\) plus\nadjustments to capture\n\n\nthe difference between the average grade overall and the average grade for the child’s class \\(U_{0j}\\),\nas well as the difference between the average slope of the Portuguese effect and the slope of that effect for their class \\(U_{1j}X_{ij}\\),\nplus any residual differences between the observed and the model predicted English grade \\(e_{ij}\\).\n\n\n\n\nIf you have had some experience analyzing psychological data, then there is a potential approach to thinking about the effect of the differences between classes that would seem natural. This approach has, in fact, been proposed (see e.g. Lorch & Myers, 1990) and applied in the literature. I would not recommend using it but thinking about it helps to develop our understanding of what we are doing with multilevel models\nWe could seek to estimate (1.) the relationship of interest – here, the association between English and Portuguese grades, while (2.) also estimating the relationship between (outcome) English grades and the impact made by what class a child is in.\nIn this approach, we would construct a model in which we have English grades as the outcome variable, Portuguese grades as one predictor variable, and then add a variable to code for class identity. The ‘effect’ of the class variable would then capture the differences in intercepts between classes. You could add a further variable to code for differences between classes in the slope of the relationship between English and Portuguese grades. This would allow for the fact that the relationship is positive or negative, stronger or weaker, in different classes.\nIf we added that further variable to code for differences between classes in the English-Portuguese relationship, then we would be estimating those differences as interactions between (1.) the predictive ‘effect’ of Portuguese grades on English grades and (2.) the class effect. An interaction effect is what we have when the effect of one variable (the predictive ‘effect’ of Portuguese grades) is different for different levels of the other variable (the predictive ‘effect’ of Portuguese grades is different for different classes).\nThinking about this approach helps us to think about what we are doing when we are working with multilevel structured data. But the problem with the approach is that it does not allow us to generalize beyond the sample we have. The estimates we would have, given a model in which we code directly for class, would tell us only about the classes in our sample.\nMost of the time, we would prefer to do analyses whose results could be generalized: to other children, to other classes, etc.. For this reason, it makes more sense to suppose that \\(U_{0j} + U_{1j}\\), the class-level deviations, are unexplained differences drawn at random from a population of potential class differences.\nWhat does this mean? Think back to your understanding of the linear model. You have learnt that when we fit a linear model like \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + e_i\\) we include a term \\(e_i\\) to represents the differences, for each child, between the observed (outcome) English grade and the English grade predicted by the relationship with Portuguese grades. Those differences between observed and predicted outcomes are called residuals. We assume that the direction and size of any one residual, for any one child, is randomly determined because we typically have no idea why there might be a big difference between the predicted and observed grade for one child but a small residual difference for another.\nNow, we can imagine that there will be many classes in many schools, and we can surely expect that there will be differences between the classes. These differences will result from plenty of factors we do not measure or cannot explain. Indeed, we have seen that there are differences between the average (outcome) English grade i.e. the predicted intercept and the observed intercept for each class, and we have seen that there are differences between the average slope of the English-Portuguese grades relationship i.e. the predicted slope and the slope for each class. These differences would, in effect, be random differences. And we can see how the variation in these differences are, for us, just a kind of random error variance, which we can see as class-level residuals.\nWe suppose, technically, that the differences between classes, controlling for the effect of the explanatory variable, are exchangeable (it does not matter which class is which), with classes varying at random. Multilevel models incorporate estimation of the explanatory variables effects \\(\\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1\\) accounting for group-level error variance \\(U_{0j} + U_{1j}\\).\nThe difference between the two-step approach and the multilevel modelling approach is this:\n\nIn the two-step approach, seen earlier, we estimate – separately, for each class – the intercept and the slope of the Portuguese effect, using just the data for that class and ignoring the data for other classes.\nIn the multilevel model, in contrast, we use all the observations, estimating the average intercept and the average slope of the Portuguese effect plus the variance due to the difference for each class (1.) between the average intercept and the class intercept or (2.) between the average slope and the class slope.\nWe can understand these differences between the average (intercept or class) and the class differences as class-level residuals \\(U_{0j} + U_{1j}\\) in addition to the child-level residuals \\(e_{ij}\\).\n\nThis leads us to a conclusion that represents a critical way to understand multilevel models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe multilevel model is a linear model but with multiple random effects terms to take into account the hierarchical structure in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can fit a multilevel model of the english ~ portuguese relationship, taking into account the fact that the pupils tested in the study were recruited from different classes, using the convenient and powerful lmer() function.\nHappily, the code we use to define a model in lmer() is much like the code we use to define a model in lm() with one important difference which I shall explain. Let’s try it out.\nTo use the lmer() function you need to make the lme4 library available.\n\nlibrary(lme4)\n\nThe model you are going to code will correspond to the statistical model that we have been discussing:\n\\[\ny_{ij} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1X_{ij} + U_{0j} + U_{1j}X_{ij} + e_{ij}\n\\]\nAnd the code is written as follows.\n\nporto.lmer1 &lt;- lmer(english ~ portuguese +\n\n                              (portuguese + 1|class_number),\n\n                              data = brazil)\n\nYou can see that the lmer() function call is closely similar to the lm() function call, with one critical exception, as I explain next.\nFirst, we have a chunk of code mostly similar to what we do when we do a regression analysis.\n\nporto.lmer1 &lt;- lmer(...) creates a linear mixed-effects model object using the lmer() function.\nenglish ~ portuguese is a formula expressing the model in which we estimate the fixed effect on the outcome or dependent variable english (English grades) predicted \\(\\sim\\) by the independent or predictor variable portuguese (Portuguese grades).\nIf there were more terms in the model, the terms would be added in series separated as variable names separated by + sum symbols.\n...(..., data = brazil) specifies the dataset in which you can find the variables named in the model fitting code.\nsummary(porto.lmer1) gets a summary of the fitted model object.\n\nSecond, we have a bit that is specific to multilevel or mixed-effects models.\n\nCritically, we add (...|class_number) to tell R about the random effects corresponding to random differences between sample groups (classes) coded by the class_number variable.\n(...1 |class_number) says that we want to estimate random differences between sample groups (classes) in intercepts coded 1.\n(portuguese... |class_number) adds random differences between sample groups (classes) in slopes of the portuguese effect coded by using the portuguese variable name.\n\nIf you run the model code as written – see the .R workbook file for an example of the code – and it works then the code will be shown in the console window in R-Studio. To show the model results, you need to get a summary of the model, using the model name.\n\nsummary(porto.lmer1)\n\n\n\nMixed-effects model code is hard to get used to at first. A bit of practice helps to show you which bits of code are important, and which bits you will change for your own analyses\n\nChange the outcome (from english) and the predictor (from portuguese): this is about changing the fixed effect part of the model.\nVary the random effects part of the model.\n\n\nChange it from (portuguese + 1 | class_number) to (1 | class_number) what you are doing is asking R to ignore the differences in the slope of the effect of Portuguese grades.\nChange it from (portuguese + 1 | class_number) to (portuguese + 0 | class_number what you are doing is asking R to ignore the differences in the intercept.\n\nTry out these variations and look carefully at the different results.\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s take a look at the results.\n\nsummary(porto.lmer1)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: english ~ portuguese + (portuguese + 1 | class_number)\n   Data: brazil\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 2104.3\n\nScaled residuals: \n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.81321 -0.59584  0.04359  0.60018  2.23722 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups       Name        Variance Std.Dev.

We will come back to p-values later but note that their absence is not a bug. Note also that we do not see an \\(R^2\\) estimate. We will come back to that too.\n\n\nThere is no convention, yet, on how to report the results of these models. Lotte Meteyard and I argue for a set of conventions that will help researchers to understand each others’ results better.\n\nIn this exercise, go read the bit where we advise Psychologists how to write about the results, in our paper (Meteyard & Davies, 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will have noticed the reference to fixed and random effects in the discussion in this chapter, and the use of fixed and random effects as titles for sections of the model output. The terms fixed effects and random effects are not used consistently in the statistical literature (Gelman & Hill, 2007). I am going to use these terms because they are helpful, at first, and because they are widely used, not least in the results of our analyses in R.\nIt is common in the psychological literature to refer to the effects on outcomes of experimental manipulations (e.g., the effect on outcomes of differences between experimental conditions) or to the effects of correlated variables of theoretical or explanatory interest (e.g., the effect of differences in Portuguese language skill) as fixed effects. Typically, we are aiming to get estimates of the coefficients of these effects. And, much like we would do when we use linear models, we expect that these coefficients represent an estimate of the effects of these variables, on average, across the population. (Hence, some analysts prefer to talk about these effects as population average effects).\nIn comparison, when we are thinking about the effects on outcomes of what we understand to be the random differences between sampled children (e.g., the child-level residuals) or the random differences between sampled classes (e.g., the class-level residuals) then we refer to these effects as random effects. As we have seen, we usually estimate random effects as variances and can estimate them as random error variances. While we may care to estimate how differences in, say, Portuguese language score, is associated with English grade, we typically do not care about the impact of the specific difference between any two classes in English grade.\nHowever, if you take your education in this area further, you will find that the way that fixed and random effects are talked about in the statistical literature can be, at best, inconsistent. And, ultimately, you might ask yourself if there are principled distinctions between fixed and random effects. We can leave these problems aside, here, because they do not influence how we shall learn and practice using multilevel models in the early to medium term in our development of skills and understanding.\n\n\n\nRecall that the linear model yields the estimate that for unit increase in Portuguese grade there is an associated .47 increase in English grade, on average Section 1.9.5. We can see that the estimate of the effect for the mixed-effects model is \\(\\beta = .659\\) which is somewhat different from the effect estimate we got from the linear model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: Does Portuguese grade predict English grade?\nResult: Our analysis shows that children who score one grade higher in their Portuguese class (e.g., 61 compared to 60) tended to score about \\(.66\\) of a grade higher in their English class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychological studies frequently result in hierarchically structured data. The structure can be understood in terms of the grouping of observations, as when there are multiple observations per group, participant or stimulus. The existence of such structure must be taken into account in analyses. Multilevel or mixed-effects models can be specified by the researcher to include random effects parameters that capture unexplained differences between participants or other sampling units in the intercepts or the slopes of explanatory variables. Where a sample of participants is asked to respond to a sample of stimuli, structure relating both to participants and to stimuli can be incorporated.\nMany researchers will be aware of concerns over the non-replication of published effects in psychological science (see the discussion here). As Gelman (2014) discusses, non-replication of results may arise if effects vary between contexts groups while traditional analytic methods assume that effects are constant. Psychological researchers can expect average outcomes and the effects of independent variables to vary among sampling units, whether their investigations involve multiple observations per child or stimulus, or children sampled within classes, clinics or schools. However, traditional analytic methods often require us to ignore this variation by averaging, say, responses over multiple trials for each child, to collapse an inherently multilevel data structure into a single level of observations that can be analysed using regression or ANOVA. By using multilevel models, researchers will, instead, be able to properly estimate the effects of theoretical interest, and better understand how those effects vary.\n\n\n\nWe outlined the features of a multilevel structure dataset.\nWe then discussed visualizing and modeling the relationship between outcome and predictor variables when you ignore the multilevel structure.\nWe examined why ignoring the structure is a bad idea.\nWe considered how slopes-as-outcomes analyses are an approximate method to take the structure into account.\nWe dmonstrated how multilevel modeling is a better method to estimate the relationship between outcome and predictor variables\n\n\n\n\nWe used functions to read-in the libraries of functions we needed.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lme4)\n\nWe used some new functions, or focused on functions we have seen before but not discussed.\n\nWe used load() to load an .RData file into R workspace.\nFor visualization, we used facet_wrap() to show plots of the relationship between English and Portuguese scores in each class separately.\nWe used lmer() to fit a multilevel model.\n\nWe used the summary() function to get model results for both linear models and for the multilevel or linear mixed-effects model.\n\n\n\n\nSnijders & Bosker (2004) present a helpful overview of multilevel modelling. Readers familiar with the book will see that I rely on it to construct the formal presentation of the models.\nGelman & Hill (2007) present a more in-depth treatment of multilevel models.\n\n\n\n\nBaayen, R.

    "text": "In this chapter, we shall start to develop skills in using a method or approach that is essential in modern data analysis: multilevel modeling. We are going to invest four weeks in working on this approach. This investment is designed to give you a specific, important, advantage in your work as a psychologist, or as someone who produces or consumes psychological research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMultilevel models: why do we need to do this? - Four weeks is a lot of time to spend on one method.\n\n\nIt is now clear that someone who works in psychological research has to know about multilevel or hierarchically structured data, and has to know how to apply multilevel models (or mixed-effects models). Growth in the popularity of these kinds of analysis has been very very rapid, as can be seen in Figure 1. It is now, effectively, the standard or default method for professional data analysis in most areas of psychological and other social or clinical sciences (or it soon will be). There are good reasons for this (Baayen et al., 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of Pubmed citations for ‘Linear Mixed Models’ by year. Generated using the tool available at http://dan.corlan.net/medline-trend.html, entering “Linear Mixed Models” as the phrase search term and using data from 2000 to 2018, from Meteyard and Davies (2020) – used without permission\n\n\n\nWe continue to teach ANOVA and multiple regression (linear models) in our courses because the research literature is full of the results of analyses done using these methods and because many psychologists continue to use these methods in their research. However, there is increasingly wide-spread recognition that these classical methods have serious problems when applied to data with hierarchical structure. Because most psychological data (not all) will have hierarchical structure, this makes learning about multilevel or mixed-effects methods a key learning objective.\nBut, because it is relatively new, many professional psychologists struggle to understand why or how to use these methods effectively. This means that students who acquire the skill graduate with a clear employability advantage. It also means that we have to take seriously the challenge of learning about these methods. This is why we will spend a bit of time on them. In my experience, in over a decade of teaching multilevel models, in working with both students and professionals, we shall need to develop understanding and skills gradually. We will work patiently, so that we can secure understanding by building our learning through a series of practical examples, increasing the scope of our practical skills, and developing the sophistication of our understanding, step-by-step, as we go.\n\n\nMultilevel models are also known as hierarchical models or linear mixed-effects models or random effects models. People use these terms interchangeably. They also use the abbreviations LMMs or LMEs. Sorry about that: humans make methods, and the names we use for things do vary.\nI will only use the terms multilevel or linear mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\nIn this chapter, we emphasize the multilevel perspective but, to anticipate future development, we will come to think in terms of mixed-effects models.",

    "text": "The key challenges for learning should be explained at the start so that we know what we shall have to do to overcome them.\n\nEven though most psychological data has some sort of multilevel or hierarchical structure, we are not used to recognizing it. This is because the structure has often been hidden or ignored in the education and practice of traditional research methods in Psychology.\n\nIn time, you will come to see multilevel structure everywhere (Kreft & Leeuw, 1998). But first you will need to get some practice so that you can become familiar with the idea and learn to recognize what it looks like when data have a multilevel or hierarchical structure. This is why we will examine multilevel structured data across a range of different kinds of experiments or surveys, over a series of weeks.\nWe will learn to identify and understand hierarchical structure in psychological data by just looking at datasets, by producing visualizations, by doing analyses, and by trying to explain to ourselves and each other what we think we see.\n\nThe ideas that support an understanding of why and how we use multilevel models can be intimidating when we first encounter them. The mathematics behind how the models work is both profound and sophisticated. But the good news is that we can practice the application of the analysis method while talking and thinking about the critical ideas using just words or plots.\n\nWe cannot or should not avoid engaging with the ideas – because we have to be able to explain what we are doing – but there are many routes to an effective understanding. For those who want to develop a more mathematically-based perspective, I will provide references to important texts in the literature on multilevel models (see Section 1.11).",

    "text": "In this chapter, we will be working with data taken from a study on education outcomes in Brazilian children, reported by Golino & Gomes (2014). First, we will progress through the steps required to download and prepare the files for analysis in R.\nThe BAFACALO_DATASET.RData data were collected and shared online by Golino & Gomes (2014). Information about the background motivating the study, the methods of data collection, along with the dataset itself, can be found here.\nGolino & Gomes (2014) collected school end-of-year subject grades for a sample of 292 children recruited from multiple classes in a school in Brazil. Here, each subject is a theme or course that children studied in school, e.g., Physics or English language, and for which each child was awarded a grade at the end of the school year. So, we have information on different children, and information about their subject grades. Children were taught in different classes but the classes appear to be units of the school organization (the information is not quite clear) not subject or course groupings. Thus, we also have information on which classes children were in when data about them were collected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the data: get the data file and the .R script you can use to do the exercises that will support your learning.\n\nYou can download the files folder for this chapter by clicking on the link 01-multilevel.zip.\n\n\n\nThe practical materials folder includes:\n\nBAFACALO_DATASET.RData\n402-01-multilevel-workbook.R the workbook you will need to do the practical exercises.\n\nThe data file is in the .RData format: .RData is R’s own file format so the code you use to load and access the data for analysis is a bit simpler than you are used to, see Section 1.7.2 next. (You will have used read.csv() or read_csv() previously.)\nIn my own practice, I prefer to keep files in formats like .csv which can be opened and read in other software applications (like Excel), so using an .RData is an exception in these materials.\nYou can also access the data from the link associated with the Golino & Gomes (2014) article here.\n\n\n\nDuring practical sessions, each week, you can use the workbook to prompt your code construction and your thinking, with support.\nAfter practical sessions, you will be able to download an answers version of the workbook .R so check back here after the session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the answers: get the data file and the .R script with answers.\n\n\n\nThe link to this folder will not be provided until after a session has finished.\nWhen the link is live, you will be able to download a folder including:\n\n402-01-multilevel-workbook-with-answers.R with answers to questions and example code for doing the exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read the BAFACALO_DATASET.RData file into the R workspace or environment using the following code.\n\nload(\"BAFACALO_DATASET.RData\")\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset consists of rows and columns.

Here, it is treating a grade score like \\(100\\) in english as a category (like you might treat \\(dog\\) as a category of pets), and you can see that the count shows you that 17 children were recorded as having scored 100 in their class. We do not want numeric variables like subject grades (e.g. children’s grades in English) treated as categorical variables, factors.\nYou can also see that R gives you a numeric summary of the recorded values in the participant_id variable. This makes no sense because the identity code numbers are (presumably) assigned at random so identity numbers provide no useful numeric information for us. We do not want this either.\nWe want R to treat the educational attainment scores as numbers. We can do this using the as.numeric() function. We want R to treat the class and participant identity numbers as factors (categorical variables). We can do this using the as.factor() function.\nWe could do this one variable at a time.\n\nbrazil$portuguese &lt;- as.numeric(brazil$portuguese)\nbrazil$english &lt;- as.numeric(brazil$english)\nbrazil$math &lt;- as.numeric(brazil$math)\nbrazil$physics &lt;- as.numeric(brazil$physics)\n\nbrazil$class_number &lt;- as.factor(brazil$class_number)\nbrazil$participant_id &lt;- as.factor(brazil$participant_id)\n\nBut it is simpler and more efficient in tidyverse style. (You can see a discussion here that helped me to figure this out.)\n\nbrazil &lt;- brazil %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(c(portuguese, english, math, physics), as.integer),\n         across(c(class_number, participant_id), as.factor)) \n\nIf you now look at the summary of the data, you can see that R will give you mean etc. for the subject class score variables e.g. english, showing that it is now treating them as numeric variables. In comparison, R gives you counts of the numbers of observations for each level (category) of categorical or nominal variables like participant_id.\n\nsummary(brazil)\n\n  class_number participant_id   portuguese       english           math       \n M11    : 21   3      :  1    Min.   : 1.00   Min.   : 1.00   Min.   :  1.00  \n M15    : 20   4      :  1    1st Qu.:26.25   1st Qu.:29.00   1st Qu.: 39.00  \n M14    : 19   5      :  1    Median :42.00   Median :55.00   Median : 58.00  \n M36    : 19   6      :  1    Mean   :43.55   Mean   :50.25   Mean   : 58.17  \n M18    : 18   7      :  1    3rd Qu.:58.75   3rd Qu.:73.00   3rd Qu.: 79.75  \n M21    : 17   9      :  1    Max.   :83.00   Max.   :93.00   Max.   :104.00  \n (Other):116   (Other):224                                                    \n    physics      \n Min.   :  1.00  \n 1st Qu.: 34.00  \n Median : 71.50  \n Mean   : 71.57  \n 3rd Qu.:107.75  \n Max.   :148.00  \n                 \n\n\n\n\nR treats things like variables as vectors. A vector can be understood to be a set or list of elements: things like numbers of words.\nR gives each vector a type (factor, numeric etc.) which helps to inform different functions how to handle that vector. Usually, R assigns type correctly but sometimes it does not. We can use what is called coercion to force R to assign the correct type to a variable.\nIt is more efficient to do this at the start of an analysis workflow.\nNormally, I would use read_csv() from tidyverse and assign type to variable using col_types() specification. (See here for more information and an example.) But it is useful to learn what you need to do if you need to change the way a variable is treated after you have got the data into the R environment.\n\n\n\nIn R, there are a family of functions that work together. You can test whether a variable (a vector, technically) is or is not a certain type using the is.[something] function. For example:\n\nis.factor(brazil$english)\nis.numeric(brazil$english)\nis.character(brazil$english)\n\nAnd you can coerce variables so that they are treated as having certain types.\n\nbrazil$english &lt;- as.factor(brazil$english)\nbrazil$english &lt;- as.numeric(brazil$english)\nbrazil$english &lt;- as.character(brazil$english)\n\nNow try it out.\n\nTest out type for different variables using is...() for some of the variables.\nTest out coercion – and its results – using as...() for some of the variables.\nLook at the results using summary().",

    "text": "We (Psychologists) often adopt Repeated Measures or Clustered designs in our studies, and these designs yield data that have a multilevel structure. Examples of research which results in data with a multilevel structure include:\n\nStudies where we test the same people multiple times, maybe in developmental or longitudinal investigations;\nIntervention, learning or treatment studies where we need to make pre- and post-treatment comparisons;\nStudies where we present multiple stimuli and everyone sees the same stimuli;\nStudies that involve multi-stage sampling e.g. selecting a sample of classes or schools then testing a sample of children within each classes or within each school.\n\nThe key insight to keep in mind when considering the analysis of such data is that observations are clustered and are not independent: they are correlated. What is correlated with what?\nImagine testing a number of subjects by giving them all the same test. In that test, you might present them all with the same stimuli over a series of trials, so that everybody sees the same set of stimuli. Do you think an observed response recorded for any one individual will be uncorrelated i.e. independent of that person’s other responses?\nPeople are different and one usually finds that a slow or inaccurate subject is slow or inaccurate for most of their responses. That means that if you have information about one of their responses you can predict, in part, what the time or accuracy of one of their other responses would be. That capacity to predict one response from another is what we mean when we talk about a lack of independence.\nAlternatively, imagine going to test children in a school. Will the children in one class be more like each other than they are like children in other classes? In other words, is there an effect of class – maybe due to the approach of the teacher, the effect of the class environment etc. – so that outcomes for children in a class are correlated with each other?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe are talking, here, about a really quite general property of data collected in certain, very widely used, designs in Psychology: the clustering or hierarchical ordering of data.\n\n\nThis week, we will see that we must deal with the dependence of observations within a class, where the observed responses were made about the different pupils tested in a class, for a number of different classes.\n\n\n\nThe utility of multilevel models to analyze multilevel data or hierarchically structured data is well established in education. In educational research, we often need to think about effects of interventions or correlations in the context of observing children in classes, schools or districts, perhaps over time or at different time points. This means that many of the critical textbooks present examples that are based on educational research data (Goldstein, 1995; Kreft & Leeuw, 1998; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Snijders & Bosker, 2004).\nMultilevel models are growing in popularity in Psychology as well as in Education because they can be used to account for systematic and random sources of variance in observed outcomes when data are hierarchically structured. A hierarchical structure is present in data when a researcher: tests participants who belong to different groups like classes, clinics or schools; presents a sample of stimuli to each member of a sample of participants; or makes repeated observations for each participant over a series of test occasions.\nIn these circumstances, the application of traditional analytic methods has typically required the researcher to aggregate their data (e.g., averaging the responses made by a participant to different stimuli) or to ignore the hierarchical structure in their data, (e.g., analyzing the responses made by some pupils while ignoring the fact that the pupils were tested in different classes). But the application of traditional analysis approaches (e.g., regression, ANOVA) to multilevel structured data extracts scientific costs (Baayen et al., 2008; Barr et al., 2013).\nIgnoring structure by ignoring or averaging over sources of variability like differences between classes, participants, or stimulus items can mean that analyses are less sensitive because they fail to fully account for error variance. Where differences between classes, participants or stimuli include variation in the impact of experimental variables, e.g., individual differences in response to an experimental manipulation, the application of traditional methods can be associated with an increased risk of false positives in discovery. Yet these costs need no longer be suffered because the capacity to perform multilevel modeling is now readily accessible.\n\n\n\nIf a researcher tests participants belonging to different groups, e.g., records the educational attainment of different children recruited from different classes in a school, the test scores for the participants are observations that occupy the lowest level of a hierarchy (see Figure 2). In multilevel modeling, those observations are understood to be nested within higher-level sampling units, here, the classes. We can say that the children are sampled from the population of children. And the classes are sampled from the population of classes. Critically, we recognize that the children’s test scores are nested within the classes. This multi-stage sampling has important consequences, as we shall see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD\n\n\n\nA\n\nA\n\n\n\nB1\n\nB1\n\n\n\nA-&gt;B1\n\n\n\n\n\nB2\n\nB2\n\n\n\nA-&gt;B2\n\n\n\n\n\nC1\n\nC1\n\n\n\nB1-&gt;C1\n\n\n\n\n\nC2\n\nC2\n\n\n\nB1-&gt;C2\n\n\n\n\n\nC3\n\nC3\n\n\n\nB1-&gt;C3\n\n\n\n\n\nC4\n\nC4\n\n\n\nB2-&gt;C4\n\n\n\n\n\nC5\n\nC5\n\n\n\nB2-&gt;C5\n\n\n\n\n\nC6\n\nC6\n\n\n\nB2-&gt;C6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Multilevel or hierarchically structured data\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are going to be working with the school data collected by Golino & Gomes (2014) in Brazil, so let’s take another look at that dataset. The data extract, following, presents the first 25 rows of the selected-variables brazil dataset. (I have arranged the rows by class number ID, and you may need to make sure the browser window is wide enough to see the data properly.) If you examine the extract, you can see that there are multiple rows of data for each class_number, one row for each child, with multiple children (you can see different participant_id numbers). This presentation of the dataset illustrates in practical terms – what you can actually see when you look at your data – what multilevel structured data can look like.\n\nbrazil %&gt;%\n       arrange(desc(class_number)) %&gt;%\n                 head(n = 25)\n\n   class_number participant_id portuguese english math physics\n1           M36             11         80      55   60      81\n2           M36             30         48      55   43      57\n3           M36             93         83      75   55      80\n4           M36             95         80      66   55      66\n5           M36            111         80      57   99     129\n6           M36            117         27      76   83      89\n7           M36            153          2      66   89     141\n8           M36            163         68      88   74     137\n9           M36            176         80      75   60     127\n10          M36            216         75      79   64     124\n11          M36            223         81      56   58      78\n12          M36            234         81      75   49      74\n13          M36            242         81      67   45      77\n14          M36            254         76      51   33     103\n15          M36            260         81      59   39      82\n16          M36            271         64      69   82     138\n17          M36            278         80      57   56     107\n18          M36            280         83      64   56      84\n19          M36            286         80      91   64      98\n20          M35             20         42      61   97      92\n21          M35            118         33      59   33      80\n22          M35            140         28      40   33      58\n23          M35            179         38      69   56     145\n24          M35            247         65      51   64      97\n25          M33             15         76      70   73      85\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognizing that the children’s scores data are observed within classes means that, when we examine the factors that influence variance in observed outcomes, we need to take into account the fact that the children can be grouped by (or under) the class they were in when their grades were recorded. We can develop an understanding of what this means by moving through a series of steps.\nTo illustrate the understanding we need to develop, we analyze the end-of-year school subject grades for the sample of 292 children studied by Golino & Gomes (2014). With these data, we can examine whether differences between children in their Portuguese language grades predicts differences in their English language grades. (We do not have a theoretical reason to make this prediction though it does not seem unreasonable.) Let’s make this our research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: Does Portuguese grade predict English grade?\n\n\n\nNow, the first step we take in our development of understanding will be to first ignore the importance of the potential differences between classes.\nWe can begin our analysis in order to address the research question by plotting the possible association between Portuguese and English grades. We shall create a scatterplot to do this, and we create the plot by running the following code and ignoring group (class) membership. In the following chunk of code, I pipe the brazil data using %&gt;% to ggplot() and then create the plot step-by-step, with each ggplot() step separated by a + except for the last step.\n\nbrazil %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = portuguese, y = english)) +\n  geom_point(colour = \"black\", size = 3, alpha = .5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", size = 2, se = FALSE, colour = \"red\") +\n  xlab(\"Portuguese\") + ylab(\"English\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Portuguese compared to English grades: each point represents the scores for one child\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that each child ID is associated with a pair of grades: their grade in English and their grade in Portuguese. Each point in Figure 3 represents the paired grade data for one child.\nBecause I say that we are interested in predicting English grades then, by convention, we map English grades to the height of the points (i.e. English grade differences are shown as differences on the y-axis). Because we are using Portuguese grades to do the predicting, by convention, we map Portuguese grades to the horizontal position of the points (i.e. Portuguese grade differences are shown as differences on the x-axis).\nI have added a line using geom_smooth() in red to indicate the trend of the potential association between variation in Portuguese grades and variation in English grades.\nFigure 3 suggests that children with higher grades in Portuguese tend, on average, to also have higher grades in English.\n\n\nNotice that when we write the code to produce the plot, we add arguments to the geom_point() and geom_smooth() function calls to adjust the appearance of the points and the smoother line. Notice, also, that we adjust the labels for the x-axis and y-axis and, finally, that we determine the overall appearance of the plot using the theme_bw() function call.\nDo the following exercises to practice your ggplot() skills\n\nChange the x and y variables to math and physics\nChange the theme from theme_bw() to something different\nChange the appearance of the points, try different colours, shapes or sizes.\n\nFurther information to help you try out coding options can be found here, on scatterplots, and here, on themes.\n\n\n\n\nOur plot indicates the relationship between English and Portuguese language grades, in Figure 3, ignoring the fact that children in the sample belonged to different classes when they were tested. The plot shows us only information about the children and grades, with each point representing the observed English and Portuguese grades for each \\(i\\) child.\nCan we predict variation in English grades given information about child Portuguese grades? Are English grades related to Portuguese grades? We can estimate the relationship between English and Portuguese grades using a linear model in which the English grades variable is the outcome variable (or the dependent variable) and the Portuguese grades variable is the predictor or independent variable:\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + e_i\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(y_i\\) represents the English grade for each \\(i\\) child;\n\\(\\beta_0\\) represents the intercept, the outcome value obtained if values of the explanatory variable are zero;\n\\(\\beta_1\\) represents the effect of variation in \\(X_i\\) the Portuguese grade for each child, with the effect of that variation estimated as the the rate of change in English grade for unit change in Portuguese grade;\n\\(e_i\\) represents differences, for each child, between the observed English grade and the English grade predicted by the relationship with Portuguese grades.\n\nAs you have seen, the code for running a linear model corresponds transparently to the statistical model given in the formula.\n\nsummary(lm(english ~ portuguese, data = brazil))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = english ~ portuguese, data = brazil)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-64.909 -17.573   2.782  20.042  53.292 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

R^2 = .13\\)). So, we have a preliminary answer to our research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: Does Portuguese grade predict English grade?\nResult: Our analysis shows that children who score one grade higher in their Portuguese class (e.g., 61 compared to 60) tended to score .47 of a grade higher in their English class.\n\n\n\nWe shall see that we will need to revise this estimate when we do an analysis that does take school class differences into account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice: here, I have dispensed with the creation of a model object by name. The model is estimated anyway, and I have embedded the lm() function call within a summary() function so that I am asking R to do two things:\n\nlm() fit a linear model\nsummary() print out a summary of the fitted model object\n\nI do this to give an example of the way in which code can be varied. Also, to show you how one function can be embedded inside another.\n\n\n\n\nDo the following exercises to practice your lm() skills\n\nChange the outcome and predictor variables to math and physics\nWhat do the results tell you about the relationship between maths and physics ability?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following discussion, I will present some model formulas as equations. I am not doing that because the discussion is going to consider the modeling in terms of the underlying mathematics. I am doing it with the aim of clarifying how quantities – observed, estimated or predicted – add up, in terms of the linear and then the linear mixed-effects model.\n\nI am going to refer to the dependent or outcome variable (e.g., school grade) as \\(y\\),\nand to explanatory or experimental or independent variables (e.g., language skill) as \\(X\\).\nModels shall be fitted to estimate the coefficients, written \\(\\beta\\), of the effects of the explanatory variables on the outcome variable\nTo distinguish the different coefficients of the different effects, I am going to number the coefficients so …\n\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) is the coefficient of the intercept;\n\\(\\beta_1\\) will be the coefficient of the effect of a first explanatory variable: in the Brazilian schools example, the coefficient of the effect of variation in Portuguese language skill on variation in English language scores.\n\nTo make it clear that each observation can be understood as part of a complex multilevel or crossed random effects structure, I am going to use indices as subscripts for variables.\n\nI will, here, index individual participants (children) using \\(i\\);\nI will index index classes in which children were tested using \\(j\\).\n\nThus, in the Brazilian schools example, we shall see that we are concerned with observations about children’s school grades, where children are sampled as individuals nested in samples of classes. We will examine how an outcome variable (English language grade) is related to a predictor variable (Portuguese language grade) such that:\n\n\\(y_{ij}\\) is the outcome English language grade recorded for each child \\(i\\) in each class \\(j\\);\nwhile \\(X_{ij}\\) represents the explanatory variable, see following, the Portuguese language grade.\n\n\\(X_{ij}\\) is subscripted \\(_{ij}\\) because values of the variable depend upon child identity, and children are identified as child \\(i\\) in class \\(j\\) to represent the multilevel structure of the data\n\n\n\nThe linear model ignores the higher-level structure, the distinction between classes: does this matter?\nWe can see the answer to that question if we inspect Figure 4. We create the plot using the following chunk of code; we discuss that later, first reflecting on what the plot shows us.\n\nbrazil %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = portuguese, y = english)) +\ngeom_point(colour = \"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, colour = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ class_number) +\n  xlab(\"Portuguese\") + ylab(\"English\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(25,50,75)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,50,100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot of child grades, comparing English with Portuguese grades, shown separately for each school class\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 presents a grid of scatterplots, with a different scatterplot to show the relationship between children’s Portuguese and English grades for the children in each different class. We can see that the relationship between Portuguese and English grades is (roughly) similar across classes: in general, children with higher Portuguese grades also tend to have higher English grades. However, Figure 4 makes it obvious that there are important differences between classes.\nWe can see that the slope of the best fit line (shown in black) varies between classes. And we can see that the intercept (where the line meets the y-axis) also varies between classes. Further, we can see that in some classes, there is no relationship or a negative relationship between Portuguese and English grades.\nCritically, we can see that classes differ in how much data we have for each. For some classes, we have many observations (e.g., M11) and for other classes we have few or one observation (e.g., M22, with one child). We know, in advance, that variation in sample size will be associated with variation in the uncertainty we have about the estimated relationship between Portuguese and English grades. You will remember that the Central Limit Theorem allows us to calculate the standard error of an estimate like the mean, given the sample size, and that the standard error is an index of our uncertainty of the estimate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFacetting – notice that, in the plotting code, the key expression is facet_wrap(~ class_number) This means:\n\nThe class_number variable is a factor: we ask R to check the summary for the dataframe, and that factor codes what class a child is in.\nThe facet_wrap(...) function then asks R to produce separate plots for each facet for the data – the word facet means face or aspect.\nWe use the formula facet_wrap(~ ...) to ask R to split the data up by using the classification information in the named variable, here class_number.\n\n\n\nThe production of a grid or lattice of plots is a useful method for comparing patterns between data sub-sets or groups. You can see more information about facet_wrap() here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAdjusting scales – notice that in these plots I modified the axes to show x-axis and y-axis ticks at specific locations using scale functions. The tick is the notch or short line where we show the numbers on the axes.\n\nscale_x_continuous(breaks=c(25,50,75)) means: set the x-axis ticks at 25, 50 and 75, defined using a vector c() of values\nscale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,50,100)) means: set the y-axis ticks at 0, 50, 100, defined using a vector of values.\n\n\n\nIt can be useful to adjust the ticks on axes, where other plot production factors cause crowding of labels.\nYou can see more information on scales here.\n\n\nDo the following exercises to practice your facet_wrap() skills\n\nChange the x and y variables to math and physics.\nExperiment with showing the differences between classes in a different way: instead of using facet_wrap() in aes() add colour = class_number: what happens?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 shows that there is variation between classes in both the average English grade, shown as differences in the y-axis intercept, and the ‘effect’ of Portuguese language skill, shown as differences in the slope of the best fit line for the predicted relationship between Portuguese and English grades.\nWe put ‘effect’ in quotes to signal the fact that we do not wish to assert a causal relation. The interpretation of the results of the linear model assumes those results are valid provided that the observations are independent, among other things. We can see that we cannot make the assumption of independence because individuals in classes with high average English grades are more likely to have higher English grades.\nWe can represent in our analysis the information we have about hierarchical structure in the data (child within class) by allowing the regression coefficients to vary between groups. We therefore modify the subscripting to take into account the fact that we must distinguish which child \\(i\\) and which class \\(j\\) we are examining, adapting our model to:\n\\[\ny_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j}X_{ij} + e_{ij}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(y_{ij}\\) represents the outcome measure, the English grade for each \\(i\\) child in each \\(j\\) class;\n\\(\\beta_{0j}\\) represents the average grade, different in different classes;\n\\(\\beta_{1j}X_{ij}\\) represents the variation in \\(X\\) the Portuguese grade for each \\(i\\) child in \\(j\\) class, with the effect of that variation estimated as the coefficient \\(\\beta_{1j}\\), different in different classes;\nand \\(e_{ij}\\) represents differences between observed and predicted English grades for each \\(i\\) child in \\(j\\) class.\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, we could capture the variation between classes by performing a two-step analysis.\n\nFirst, we estimate the coefficient of the ‘Portuguese’ effect for each class separately. We do multiple (per-class) analyses. In each of these analyses, we estimate the coefficient looking only at the data for one class.\nSecond, we can take those per-class coefficients as the outcome variable in a ‘slopes-as-outcomes analysis’ to examine if the per-class estimates of the experimental effect are reliably different from zero or, more usefully, if the per-class estimates vary in relation to some explanatory variable like teacher skill.\n\nThe problem with the approach is apparent in Figure 5: the figure shows the estimated intercept and coefficient of the slope of the ‘Portuguese’ effect for each class, when we have analyzed the data for each class in a separate linear model.\nThe estimate for each class is shown as a black dot. The standard error of the estimate is shown as a black vertical line, shown above and below a point.\nYou can say that where there is a longer line there we have more uncertainty about the location of the estimate. Notice that the standard errors vary a lot between classes. In some classes, the standard error is small (the black line is short) so we can maybe have more certainty over the estimated intercept or slope for those classes. In other classes, the standard error is large (the black line is long) so we can maybe have less certainty over the estimated intercept or slope for those classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe key idea here is that standard errors vary widely between classes but the two-step modeling approach, while it can take into account the between-class differences in estimates, cannot account for the variation in the standard errors about those estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Plot showing the estimated intercept and coefficient of the slope of the Portuguese effect for each class analysed separately\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that the code I used fits a separate model for each class, and then plots the per-class estimates of intercepts and slopes of the english ~ portuguese relationship.\n\n\n(In case you want to see how this plot is produced, I work through the code for drawing Figure 5 in the workbook .R.)\n\n\nThe ‘slopes-as-outcomes’ approach is quite common and can be found in a number of papers in the psychological and educational research literatures. An influential example can be found in the report by Balota et al. (2004) of their analysis of psycholinguistic effects in older and younger adults. Balota et al. (2004) wanted to examine if or how effects of variables like word frequency, on reading response latencies, were different in different age groups. To do this, they first estimated the effect of the (word-level) psycholinguistic variables in separate linear model (multple regressions) for each adult. They then took the estimated coefficients as the dependent variable (slopes-as-outcomes) for a second analysis in which they tested the effect of age group on variation in the estimated coefficients (see Lorch & Myers (1990) for a discussion of the approach).\nYou may be asked to do this. I would advise you against it because there is a better way, as we see next.\n\n\n\n\nMultilevel models incorporate estimates of the intercept and the effect of independent (experimental or correlational) variables plus estimates of the random variation between classes in intercepts and slopes. Multilevel models are also known as mixed-effects models because they involve the estimation of fixed effects (effects due to independent variables) and random effects (effects due to random differences between groups).\nWe model the intercept (varying between classes) as:\n\\[\n\\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_0 + U_{0j}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\beta_{0j}\\) values equal \\(\\gamma_0\\) the overall average intercept,\nplus \\(U_{0j}\\) the differences, for each class, between that average intercept and the intercept for that class.\n\nWe model the coefficient of the (Portuguese language) skill effect as:\n\\[\n\\beta_{1j} = \\gamma_1 + U_{1j}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\beta_{1j}\\) values equal \\(\\gamma_1\\) the average slope,\nplus \\(U_{1j}\\) the differences, for each class, between that average slope and the slope for that class.\n\nThese models can then be combined:\n\\[\ny_{ij} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1X_{ij} + U_{0j} + U_{1j}X_{ij} + e_{ij}\n\\]\nsuch that the English grade observed for each child \\(y_{ij}\\) can be predicted given:\n\nthe average grade overall \\(\\gamma_0\\) plus\nthe average relationship between English and Portuguese language skills \\(\\gamma_1\\) plus\nadjustments to capture\n\n\nthe difference between the average grade overall and the average grade for the child’s class \\(U_{0j}\\),\nas well as the difference between the average slope of the Portuguese effect and the slope of that effect for their class \\(U_{1j}X_{ij}\\),\nplus any residual differences between the observed and the model predicted English grade \\(e_{ij}\\).\n\n\n\n\nIf you have had some experience analyzing psychological data, then there is a potential approach to thinking about the effect of the differences between classes that would seem natural. This approach has, in fact, been proposed (see e.g. Lorch & Myers, 1990) and applied in the literature. I would not recommend using it but thinking about it helps to develop our understanding of what we are doing with multilevel models\nWe could seek to estimate (1.) the relationship of interest – here, the association between English and Portuguese grades, while (2.) also estimating the relationship between (outcome) English grades and the impact made by what class a child is in.\nIn this approach, we would construct a model in which we have English grades as the outcome variable, Portuguese grades as one predictor variable, and then add a variable to code for class identity. The ‘effect’ of the class variable would then capture the differences in intercepts between classes. You could add a further variable to code for differences between classes in the slope of the relationship between English and Portuguese grades. This would allow for the fact that the relationship is positive or negative, stronger or weaker, in different classes.\nIf we added that further variable to code for differences between classes in the English-Portuguese relationship, then we would be estimating those differences as interactions between (1.) the predictive ‘effect’ of Portuguese grades on English grades and (2.) the class effect. An interaction effect is what we have when the effect of one variable (the predictive ‘effect’ of Portuguese grades) is different for different levels of the other variable (the predictive ‘effect’ of Portuguese grades is different for different classes).\nThinking about this approach helps us to think about what we are doing when we are working with multilevel structured data. But the problem with the approach is that it does not allow us to generalize beyond the sample we have. The estimates we would have, given a model in which we code directly for class, would tell us only about the classes in our sample.\nMost of the time, we would prefer to do analyses whose results could be generalized: to other children, to other classes, etc.. For this reason, it makes more sense to suppose that \\(U_{0j} + U_{1j}\\), the class-level deviations, are unexplained differences drawn at random from a population of potential class differences.\nWhat does this mean? Think back to your understanding of the linear model. You have learnt that when we fit a linear model like \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_i + e_i\\) we include a term \\(e_i\\) to represents the differences, for each child, between the observed (outcome) English grade and the English grade predicted by the relationship with Portuguese grades. Those differences between observed and predicted outcomes are called residuals. We assume that the direction and size of any one residual, for any one child, is randomly determined because we typically have no idea why there might be a big difference between the predicted and observed grade for one child but a small residual difference for another.\nNow, we can imagine that there will be many classes in many schools, and we can surely expect that there will be differences between the classes. These differences will result from plenty of factors we do not measure or cannot explain. Indeed, we have seen that there are differences between the average (outcome) English grade i.e. the predicted intercept and the observed intercept for each class, and we have seen that there are differences between the average slope of the English-Portuguese grades relationship i.e. the predicted slope and the slope for each class. These differences would, in effect, be random differences. And we can see how the variation in these differences are, for us, just a kind of random error variance, which we can see as class-level residuals.\nWe suppose, technically, that the differences between classes, controlling for the effect of the explanatory variable, are exchangeable (it does not matter which class is which), with classes varying at random. Multilevel models incorporate estimation of the explanatory variables effects \\(\\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1\\) accounting for group-level error variance \\(U_{0j} + U_{1j}\\).\nThe difference between the two-step approach and the multilevel modelling approach is this:\n\nIn the two-step approach, seen earlier, we estimate – separately, for each class – the intercept and the slope of the Portuguese effect, using just the data for that class and ignoring the data for other classes.\nIn the multilevel model, in contrast, we use all the observations, estimating the average intercept and the average slope of the Portuguese effect plus the variance due to the difference for each class (1.) between the average intercept and the class intercept or (2.) between the average slope and the class slope.\nWe can understand these differences between the average (intercept or class) and the class differences as class-level residuals \\(U_{0j} + U_{1j}\\) in addition to the child-level residuals \\(e_{ij}\\).\n\nThis leads us to a conclusion that represents a critical way to understand multilevel models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe multilevel model is a linear model but with multiple random effects terms to take into account the hierarchical structure in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can fit a multilevel model of the english ~ portuguese relationship, taking into account the fact that the pupils tested in the study were recruited from different classes, using the convenient and powerful lmer() function.\nHappily, the code we use to define a model in lmer() is much like the code we use to define a model in lm() with one important difference which I shall explain. Let’s try it out.\nTo use the lmer() function you need to make the lme4 library available.\n\nlibrary(lme4)\n\nThe model you are going to code will correspond to the statistical model that we have been discussing:\n\\[\ny_{ij} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1X_{ij} + U_{0j} + U_{1j}X_{ij} + e_{ij}\n\\]\nAnd the code is written as follows.\n\nporto.lmer1 &lt;- lmer(english ~ portuguese +\n\n                              (portuguese + 1|class_number),\n\n                              data = brazil)\n\nYou can see that the lmer() function call is closely similar to the lm() function call, with one critical exception, as I explain next.\nFirst, we have a chunk of code mostly similar to what we do when we do a regression analysis.\n\nporto.lmer1 &lt;- lmer(...) creates a linear mixed-effects model object using the lmer() function.\nenglish ~ portuguese is a formula expressing the model in which we estimate the fixed effect on the outcome or dependent variable english (English grades) predicted \\(\\sim\\) by the independent or predictor variable portuguese (Portuguese grades).\nIf there were more terms in the model, the terms would be added in series separated as variable names separated by + sum symbols.\n...(..., data = brazil) specifies the dataset in which you can find the variables named in the model fitting code.\nsummary(porto.lmer1) gets a summary of the fitted model object.\n\nSecond, we have a bit that is specific to multilevel or mixed-effects models.\n\nCritically, we add (...|class_number) to tell R about the random effects corresponding to random differences between sample groups (classes) coded by the class_number variable.\n(...1 |class_number) says that we want to estimate random differences between sample groups (classes) in intercepts coded 1.\n(portuguese... |class_number) adds random differences between sample groups (classes) in slopes of the portuguese effect coded by using the portuguese variable name.\n\nIf you run the model code as written – see the .R workbook file for an example of the code – and it works then the code will be shown in the console window in R-Studio. To show the model results, you need to get a summary of the model, using the model name.\n\nsummary(porto.lmer1)\n\n\n\nMixed-effects model code is hard to get used to at first. A bit of practice helps to show you which bits of code are important, and which bits you will change for your own analyses\n\nChange the outcome (from english) and the predictor (from portuguese): this is about changing the fixed effect part of the model.\nVary the random effects part of the model.\n\n\nChange it from (portuguese + 1 | class_number) to (1 | class_number) what you are doing is asking R to ignore the differences in the slope of the effect of Portuguese grades.\nChange it from (portuguese + 1 | class_number) to (portuguese + 0 | class_number what you are doing is asking R to ignore the differences in the intercept.\n\nTry out these variations and look carefully at the different results.\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s take a look at the results.\n\nsummary(porto.lmer1)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: english ~ portuguese + (portuguese + 1 | class_number)\n   Data: brazil\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 2104.3\n\nScaled residuals: \n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.81321 -0.59584  0.04359  0.60018  2.23722 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups       Name        Variance Std.Dev.

We will come back to p-values later but note that their absence is not a bug. Note also that we do not see an \\(R^2\\) estimate. We will come back to that too.\n\n\nThere is no convention, yet, on how to report the results of these models. Lotte Meteyard and I argue for a set of conventions that will help researchers to understand each others’ results better.\n\nIn this exercise, go read the bit where we advise Psychologists how to write about the results, in our paper (Meteyard & Davies, 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will have noticed the reference to fixed and random effects in the discussion in this chapter, and the use of fixed and random effects as titles for sections of the model output. The terms fixed effects and random effects are not used consistently in the statistical literature (Gelman & Hill, 2007). I am going to use these terms because they are helpful, at first, and because they are widely used, not least in the results of our analyses in R.\nIt is common in the psychological literature to refer to the effects on outcomes of experimental manipulations (e.g., the effect on outcomes of differences between experimental conditions) or to the effects of correlated variables of theoretical or explanatory interest (e.g., the effect of differences in Portuguese language skill) as fixed effects. Typically, we are aiming to get estimates of the coefficients of these effects. And, much like we would do when we use linear models, we expect that these coefficients represent an estimate of the effects of these variables, on average, across the population. (Hence, some analysts prefer to talk about these effects as population average effects).\nIn comparison, when we are thinking about the effects on outcomes of what we understand to be the random differences between sampled children (e.g., the child-level residuals) or the random differences between sampled classes (e.g., the class-level residuals) then we refer to these effects as random effects. As we have seen, we usually estimate random effects as variances and can estimate them as random error variances. While we may care to estimate how differences in, say, Portuguese language score, is associated with English grade, we typically do not care about the impact of the specific difference between any two classes in English grade.\nHowever, if you take your education in this area further, you will find that the way that fixed and random effects are talked about in the statistical literature can be, at best, inconsistent. And, ultimately, you might ask yourself if there are principled distinctions between fixed and random effects. We can leave these problems aside, here, because they do not influence how we shall learn and practice using multilevel models in the early to medium term in our development of skills and understanding.\n\n\n\nRecall that the linear model yields the estimate that for unit increase in Portuguese grade there is an associated .47 increase in English grade, on average Section 1.9.5. We can see that the estimate of the effect for the mixed-effects model is \\(\\beta = .659\\) which is somewhat different from the effect estimate we got from the linear model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: Does Portuguese grade predict English grade?\nResult: Our analysis shows that children who score one grade higher in their Portuguese class (e.g., 61 compared to 60) tended to score about \\(.66\\) of a grade higher in their English class.",

    "text": "Psychological studies frequently result in hierarchically structured data. The structure can be understood in terms of the grouping of observations, as when there are multiple observations per group, participant or stimulus. The existence of such structure must be taken into account in analyses. Multilevel or mixed-effects models can be specified by the researcher to include random effects parameters that capture unexplained differences between participants or other sampling units in the intercepts or the slopes of explanatory variables. Where a sample of participants is asked to respond to a sample of stimuli, structure relating both to participants and to stimuli can be incorporated.\nMany researchers will be aware of concerns over the non-replication of published effects in psychological science (see the discussion here). As Gelman (2014) discusses, non-replication of results may arise if effects vary between contexts groups while traditional analytic methods assume that effects are constant. Psychological researchers can expect average outcomes and the effects of independent variables to vary among sampling units, whether their investigations involve multiple observations per child or stimulus, or children sampled within classes, clinics or schools. However, traditional analytic methods often require us to ignore this variation by averaging, say, responses over multiple trials for each child, to collapse an inherently multilevel data structure into a single level of observations that can be analysed using regression or ANOVA. By using multilevel models, researchers will, instead, be able to properly estimate the effects of theoretical interest, and better understand how those effects vary.\n\n\n\nWe outlined the features of a multilevel structure dataset.\nWe then discussed visualizing and modeling the relationship between outcome and predictor variables when you ignore the multilevel structure.\nWe examined why ignoring the structure is a bad idea.\nWe considered how slopes-as-outcomes analyses are an approximate method to take the structure into account.\nWe dmonstrated how multilevel modeling is a better method to estimate the relationship between outcome and predictor variables\n\n\n\n\nWe used functions to read-in the libraries of functions we needed.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lme4)\n\nWe used some new functions, or focused on functions we have seen before but not discussed.\n\nWe used load() to load an .RData file into R workspace.\nFor visualization, we used facet_wrap() to show plots of the relationship between English and Portuguese scores in each class separately.\nWe used lmer() to fit a multilevel model.\n\nWe used the summary() function to get model results for both linear models and for the multilevel or linear mixed-effects model.",

    "text": "Welcome to your overview of the work we will do together in Week 16.\nWe are going to learn about a method or approach that is essential in modern data analysis: multilevel modeling.\nWe are going to invest the next few weeks in working on this approach.\nWe are going to do this because multilevel modeling is a very powerful and very flexible technique, and because you will learn best if you take the time to build up and deepen your understanding step-by-step.\n\n\nOur learning objectives include the development of key concepts and skills.\n\nconcepts – how data can have multilevel structures and what this requires in models\nskills – where skills comprise the capacity to:\n\n\nuse visualization to examine observations within groups\nrun linear models over all data and within each class\nuse the lmer() function to fit models of multilevel data\n\nWe are just getting started this week. Our plan will be to build depth and breadth in understanding as we progress over the next few weeks.\n\n\n\nYou will see, next, the lectures we share to explain the concepts you will learn about, and the practical data analysis skills you will develop. Then you will see information about the practical materials you can use to build and practise your skills.\nEvery week, you will learn best if you first watch the lectures then do the practical exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinked resources\n\n\n\nTo help your learning, you can read about the ideas and the practical coding required for analyses in the chapters I wrote for this course.\nThe chapter: Conceptual introduction to multilevel data\n\n\n\n\nThe lecture materials for this week are presented in three short parts.\nClick on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part.\n\nPart 1 (17 minutes) Multilevel data: What do we mean when we talk about multilevel structured data and why it matters.\n\n\n\nPart 2 (13 minutes): Getting started in learning, working with an example from education, children clustered in classes, analyzing data using linear models, seeing the differences between different classes.\n\n\n\nPart 3 (13 minutes): Doing multilevel models in practice, coding models using lmer(), a first look at analysis results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the lecture slides\n\n\n\nThe slides presented in the videos can be downloaded here:\n\n402-week-17-LME-1.pdf: high resolution .pdf, exactly as delivered [4 MB];\n402-week-17-LME-1_1pp.pdf: low resolution .pdf, printable version, one-slide-per-page [359 KB];\n402-week-17-LME-1_6pp.pdf: low resolution .pdf, printable version, six-slides-per-page [359 KB].\n\nThe high resolution version is the version delivered for the lecture recordings. Because the images are produced to be high resolution, the file size is quite big (4 MB) so, to make the slides easier to download, I produced low resolution versions: 1pp and 6pp. These should be easier to download and print out if that is what you want to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be working with data taken from a study on education outcomes in Brazilian children, reported by Golino & Gomes (2014).\nYou can read more about these data in Conceptual introduction to multilevel data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the data: get the data file and the .R script you can use to do the exercises that will support your learning.\n\nYou can download the files folder for this chapter by clicking on the link 01-multilevel.zip.\n\n\n\nThe practical materials folder includes:\n\nBAFACALO_DATASET.RData\n402-01-multilevel-workbook.R the workbook you can use to do the practical exercises.\n\nThe data file is in the .RData format: .RData is R’s own file format so the

data – and within each class\nskills: use the lmer() function to fit models of multilevel data\n\nThe aims of the practical work are to:\n\nGet practice running the code so that you can reproduce the figures and results from the lecture and in the book chapter.\nExercise skills by varying code – changing variables, changing options – so that you can see how the code works.\nUse the opportunity to reflect on and evaluate results – so that we can support growth in development of understanding of main ideas.\n\n\n\n\nNow you will progress through a series of tasks, and challenges, to aid your learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWe will work with the data file:\n\nAFACALO_DATASET.RData\n\n\n\nWe again split the steps into into parts, tasks and questions.\nWe are going to work through the

There is a convergence warning for:\n\nenglish ~ portuguese + (portuguese + 0 | class_number)\n\n\n\nChange the outcome (from english) and the predictor (from portuguese) – this is about changing the fixed effect part of the model.\n\nNote that you will need to change the random effect part as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nporto.lmer1 &lt;- lmer(physics ~ math +\n                      (math + 1|class_number),\n                    data = brazil)\n\nboundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')\n\nsummary(porto.lmer1)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: physics ~ math + (math + 1 | class_number)\n   Data: brazil\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 2066\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.9688 -0.5956  0.0461  0.6276  3.4865 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups       Name        Variance  Std.Dev.

    "text": "You will see, next, the lectures we share to explain the concepts you will learn about, and the practical data analysis skills you will develop. Then you will see information about the practical materials you can use to build and practise your skills.\nEvery week, you will learn best if you first watch the lectures then do the practical exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinked resources\n\n\n\nTo help your learning, you can read about the ideas and the practical coding required for analyses in the chapters I wrote for this course.\nThe chapter: Conceptual introduction to multilevel data\n\n\n\n\nThe lecture materials for this week are presented in three short parts.\nClick on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part.\n\nPart 1 (17 minutes) Multilevel data: What do we mean when we talk about multilevel structured data and why it matters.\n\n\n\nPart 2 (13 minutes): Getting started in learning, working with an example from education, children clustered in classes, analyzing data using linear models, seeing the differences between different classes.\n\n\n\nPart 3 (13 minutes): Doing multilevel models in practice, coding models using lmer(), a first look at analysis results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the lecture slides\n\n\n\nThe slides presented in the videos can be downloaded here:\n\n402-week-17-LME-1.pdf: high resolution .pdf, exactly as delivered [4 MB];\n402-week-17-LME-1_1pp.pdf: low resolution .pdf, printable version, one-slide-per-page [359 KB];\n402-week-17-LME-1_6pp.pdf: low resolution .pdf, printable version, six-slides-per-page [359 KB].\n\nThe high resolution version is the version delivered for the lecture recordings. Because the images are produced to be high resolution, the file size is quite big (4 MB) so, to make the slides easier to download, I produced low resolution versions: 1pp and 6pp. These should be easier to download and print out if that is what you want to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be working with data taken from a study on education outcomes in Brazilian children, reported by Golino & Gomes (2014).\nYou can read more about these data in Conceptual introduction to multilevel data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the data: get the data file and the .R script you can use to do the exercises that will support your learning.\n\nYou can download the files folder for this chapter by clicking on the link 01-multilevel.zip.\n\n\n\nThe practical materials folder includes:\n\nBAFACALO_DATASET.RData\n402-01-multilevel-workbook.R the workbook you can use to do the practical exercises.\n\nThe data file is in the .RData format: .RData is R’s own file format so the code you use to load and access the data for analysis is a bit simpler than you are used to, as we will see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou can access the sign-in page for R-Studio Server here\n\n\n\n\nHere, our learning targets are:\n\nconcepts: multilevel data and multilevel modeling\nskills: visualization – examine overall and within-class trends\nskills: run linear models over all data – and within each class\nskills: use the lmer() function to fit models of multilevel data\n\nThe aims of the practical work are to:\n\nGet practice running the code so that you can reproduce the figures and results from the lecture and in the book chapter.\nExercise skills by varying code – changing variables, changing options – so that you can see how the code works.\nUse the opportunity to reflect on and evaluate results – so that we can support growth in development of understanding of main ideas.\n\n\n\n\nNow you will progress through a series of tasks, and challenges, to aid your learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWe will work with the data file:\n\nAFACALO_DATASET.RData\n\n\n\nWe again split the steps into into parts, tasks and questions.\nWe are going to work through the following workflow steps: each step is labelled as a practical part.\n\nSet-up\nLoad the data\nInspect the data\nVisualize relationships\nAnalyze relationships using linear models\nVisualize relationships for each class\nMixed-effects analysis\nOptional exercises: extensions\n\nIn the following, we will guide you through the tasks and questions step by step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAn answers version of the workbook will be revealed after the practical class.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo begin, we set up our environment in R.\n\n\nUse the library() function

Be careful and make sure you go back to select the variables shown in the given code chunk: we will need them later.\n\n\n\n\nThere are several rows in the data-set with missing values.

    "text": "In the conceptual introduction to multilevel data and the workbook introduction to multilevel data chapters, we looked at a multilevel structured data-set in which there were observations about children’s grades, and it became evident that those children can be grouped by or under classes. As we discussed, this kind of data structure will come from studies with a very common design in which, for example, the researcher records observations about a sample of children who are members of a sample of classes. In working with these kind of data, it is common to say that the observations of children’s grades are nested within classes in a hierarchy.\nMany Psychologists conduct studies where observations are properly understood to be structured in groups of some form but where, nevertheless, it is inappropriate to think of the observations as being nested (Baayen et al., 2008). We are talking, here, about repeated-measures designs where the experimenter presents a sample of multiple stimuli for response to each participant in a sample of multiple participants. This is another very common experimental design in psychological science.\nStudies with repeated-measures designs will produce data with a structure that, also, requires the use of mixed-effects models but, as we shall see, the way we think about the structure will be a bit more complicated. We could say that observations of the responses made by participants to each stimulus can be grouped by participant: each person will tend to respond in similar ways to different stimuli. Or, we could say that observations of responses can be grouped by stimulus because each stimulus will tend to evoke similar kinds of responses in different people. Or, we could say that both forms of grouping should be taken into account at the same time.\nWe shall take the third position and this chapter will concern why, and how we will adapt our thinking and practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick start: Workbook introduction to mixed-effects models\n\n\n\nThis chapter presents ideas and methods relating to the analysis of repeated-measures data using mixed-effects models in which we extend the ideas and the methods in depth.\n\nYou can find a quick start, focused on practical analysis steps, in the workbook introduction to mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nLinear mixed-effects models and multilevel models are basically the same.\n\n\nThis week, we again look at data with multilevel structure. But we are looking at data where participants were asked to respond to a set of stimuli (here, words) so that our observations consist of recordings made of the response made by each child to each stimulus. We use the same procedure we did for multilevel data but with one significant change which we shall identify and explain.\n\n\n\nOur learning objectives again include the development of both concepts and skills.\n\nskills – practice how to tidy experimental data for mixed-effects analysis.\nconcepts – begin to develop an understanding of crossed random effects of participants and stimuli.\nskills and concepts – practice fitting linear mixed-effects models incorporating random effects of participants and stimuli.\n\n\n\n\nI have provided a collection of materials you can use. Here, I explain what they are and how I suggest you use them.\n1. Video recordings of lectures\n1.1. I have recorded a lecture in three parts. The lectures should be accessible by anyone who has the link.\n\nPart 1 – about 8 minutes\nPart 2 – about 21 minutes\nPart 3 – about 15 minutes\n\n1.2. I suggest you watch the recordings then read the rest of this chapter.\n\nThe lectures provide a summary of the main points.\n\n1.3. You can download the lecture slides in three different versions:\n\n402-week-18-LME-2.pdf: high resolution .pdf, exactly as delivered [6 MB];\n402-week-18-LME-2_1pp-lo.pdf: lower resolution .pdf, printable version, one-slide-per-page [about 900 KB];\n402-week-18-LME-2_6pp-lo.pdf: lower resolution .pdf, printable version, six-slides-per-page [about 900 KB].\n\nThe high resolution version is the version delivered for the lecture recordings. Because the images are produced to be high resolution, the file size is quite big (6 MB) so, to make the slides easier to download, I produced low resolution versions: 1pp and 6pp. These should be easier to download and print out if that is what you want to do.\n2. Chapter: 02-mixed\n2.1. I have written this chapter to discuss the main ideas and set out the practical steps you can follow to start to develop the skills required to analyse multilevel structured data with crossed random effects.\n2.2. The practical elements include data tidying, visualization and analysis steps.\n2.3. You can read the chapter, run the code, and do the exercises.\n\nRead in the example CP reading study data-sets.\nIdentify how the data are structured by both participant and stimulus differences.\nUse visualizations to explore the impact of the structure.\nRun analyses using linear mixed-effects models involving multiple random effects.\nReview the recommended readings (Section 1.14).\n\n3. Practical materials\n3.1 In the following sections, I describe the practical steps, and associated practical materials (exercise workbooks and data), you can use for your learning.\n\n\n\nIn this chapter, we will be working with the CP reading study data-set. CP tested 62 children (aged 116-151 months) on reading aloud in English. In the experimental reading task, she presented 160 words as stimuli. The same 160 words were presented to all children. The words were presented one at a time on a computer screen. Each time a word was shown, each child had to read the word out loud and their response was recorded. Thus, the CP reading study data-set comprised observations about the responses made by 62 children to 160 words.\nIn addition to the reading task, CP administered tests of reading skill (TOWRE sight word and phonemic tests, Torgesen et al., 1999), reading experience (CART, Stainthorp, 1997), the Spoonerisms sub-test of the Phonological Awareness test Battery (PhAB, Frederickson et al., 1997), and an orthographic choice test measure of orthographic knowledge. She also recorded the gender and the handedness of the children.\nWe are going to use the CP study data to examine the answers to a research question similar to the question CP investigated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: What word properties influence responses to words in a test of reading aloud?\n\n\n\nWe can look at the answers to this question while also taking into account the impacts of random differences – between sampled participants or between sampled words – using mixed-effects models.\nUltimately, the CP data-set were incorporated in an analysis of the impact of age on reading skills over the life-span, reported by Davies et al. (2017). You can find more details on the data and the methods in that paper. (Data and analysis code are shared through the journal article webpage [paywalled] here, and a preprint version of the article can be accessed here.)\nThe CP study resembles many studies in psychological science. The critical features of the study are that:\n\nWe have an outcome measure – the reading response – observed multiple times.\n\n\nWe have multiple responses recorded for each participant: they make one response to each stimulus (here, each stimulus word), for the multiple stimuli that they see in the experimental reading task.\nAnd we have multiple responses recorded for each stimulus: one response is made to each stimulus by each participant, for all the participants who completed the task, in a sample of multiple participants.\n\nThe presence of these features is the reason why we need to use mixed-effects models in our analysis. These features are common across a range of study designs so the lessons we learn will apply frequently in psychological research. This is the reason why it is important we teach and learn how to use mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the data: get the data file and the .R script you can use to do the exercises that will support your learning.\n\nYou can download the files folder for this chapter by clicking on the link 02-mixed.zip.\n\n\n\nThe practical materials folder includes data files and an .R script:\n\nCP study word naming rt 180211.dat\nCP study word naming acc 180211.dat\nwords.items.5 120714 150916.csv\nall.subjects 110614-050316-290518.csv\nlong.all.noNAs.csv\n402-02-mixed-workbook.R the workbook you will need to do the practical exercises.\n\nThe .dat files are tab delimited files holding behavioural data: the latency or reaction time rt (in milliseconds) and the accuracy acc of response made by each participant to each stimulus.\nThe .csv files are comma separated values files. The words.items file holds information about the 160 stimulus words presented in the experimental reading (word naming) task. The all.subjects file holds information about the 62 participants who volunteered to take part in the experiment.\nSo: we will be working with multiple data files located in a .zip folder called 02-mixed. And, in this folder, we have got four files that we will need to import or read in to R.\nIn the following, I will describe a series of steps through which we get the data ready for analysis. However, as we shall see, you can avoid these steps by using the pre-tidied data-set:\n\nlong.all.noNAs.csv\n\nThe data files are collected together with the .R script:\n\n402-02-mixed-workbook.R.\n\nDuring practical sessions, each week, you can use the workbook to prompt your code construction and your thinking, with support.\n\n\nAfter practical sessions, you will be able to download an answers version of the workbook .R so check back here after the session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the answers: get the data file and the .R script with answers.\n\nYou can download the files folder for this chapter by clicking on the link 02-mixed-answers.zip.\n\n\n\nThe link to this folder will not work until after a session has finished.\nWhen the link is live, you will be able to download a folder including:\n\n402-02-mixed-workbook-with-answers.R with answers to questions and example code for doing the exercises.\n\nBefore we do anything else, we need to talk about the messiness of real Psychological data and how we deal with it.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdinarily, textbooks and guides to data analysis give you the data ready for analysis but this situation will never be true for your professional practice (at least, not at first). Instead of pretending that data arrive ready for analysis, we are going to look at the process of data tidying, step-by-step. This will help you to get ready for the same process when you have to develop and use it in your own research.\nWe are going to spend a bit of time looking at the data tidying process. This process involves identifying and resolving a series of challenges, in order. Looking at the tidying process will give you a concrete sense of the structure in the data. You should also take this opportunity to reflect on the nature of the process itself – what we have to do and why, in what order and why – so that you can develop a sense of the process you might need to build when the time comes for you to prepare your own data for analysis.\nThe time that we spend looking at data tidying is an investment in learning that will save you time later, in your professional work. If, however, you want to skip it, go to section Section 1.8.\n\n\nIn analyzing psychological data, the first step is usually to collect the data together. In psychological research, the data may exist, at first, in separate files. For the CP study, we have separate files for each of the pieces of information we need to use in our analyses:\n\nParticipant attributes: information about participants’ age, gender, identifier code, and abilities on various measures.\nStimulus attributes: information about stimulus items, e.g., the word, its item number, its value on each variable in a set of psycholinguistic properties (like word length, frequency).\nBehaviour: behavioural observations e.g. reaction time or accuracy of responses made by each participant to each stimulus word.\n\nOften, we need all these kinds of information for our analyses but different pieces of information are produced in separate ways and come to us in separate files. For example, we may collect experimental response data using software like PsychoPy, E-Prime, Qualtrics or DMDX. We may collect information about participant characteristics using standardized measures, or by asking participants to complete a set of questions on their age, gender, and so on.\n\n\n\nOften, the files we get are untidy: not in a useful or tidy format. For example, if you open the file CP_study_word_naming_rt_180211.dat (a .dat or tab delimited file) in Excel, you will see a spreadsheet that looks like Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: CP study RTs .dat file\n\n\n\nTypical of the output from data collection software, we can see a data table with:\n\nin the top row, column header labels item_name, AislingoC, AllanaD ...;\nin the first (leftmost) column, row labels item_name, act, ask, both ...;\nfor each row, we see values equal to the reaction time (RT) observed for the response made to each stimulus (listed in the row labels);\nfor each column, we see values equal to the RTs observed for each person (listed in the column labels);\nand at each intersection of row and column (for each cell), we see the RT observed for a response made by a participant to a stimulus.\n\nData laid out like this are sometimes said to be in wide format. You can see that the data are wide because at least one variable – here, reading reaction time – is held not in one column but spread out over several columns, side-by-side. Thus, the data-set is wide with fewer rows and many columns.\nWe want the data in what is called the tidy format.\n\n\nThere are three inter-related rules which make data tidy (Grolemund & Wickham, n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn tidy data:\n\nEach variable must have its own column.\nEach observation must have its own row.\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\n\n\nYou can read more about tidy data here.\nFor our purposes, the reason we want the data in tidy format is that it is required for the functions we are going to use for mixed-effects modelling. However, in general, tidy format is maximally flexible, and convenient, for use with different R functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer our research question, we will need to combine the behavioural data with information about the participants (age, gender …) and about the words (word, frequency …) We will need to ensure that the data-set we construct will be in tidy format. We will need to select variables (columns) to get just those required for our later analyses. And we will need to filter cases (rows), excluding errors or outliers.\nWe shall need to do this work in a series of processing steps:\n\nImport the data or read the data into R, see Section 1.7.1\nRestructure the data, see Section 1.7.3\nSelect or transform variables, see Section 1.7.6\nFilter observations, see Section 1.7.7\n\nWe will use {tidyverse} library functions from the beginning, starting with the import stage.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n(Every step can also be done in alternative processing steps with the same result using base R code.)\n\n\nI am going to assume you have downloaded the data files, that they are all in the same folder, and that you know where they are on your computer or server. We need to use different versions of the read_ function to read all four files into R.\n\nbehaviour.rt &lt;- read_tsv(\"CP study word naming rt 180211.dat\", na = \"-999\")\nbehaviour.acc &lt;- read_tsv(\"CP study word naming acc 180211.dat\", na = \"-999\")\nsubjects &lt;- read_csv(\"all.subjects 110614-050316-290518.csv\", na = \"-999\")\nwords &lt;- read_csv(\"words.items.5 120714 150916.csv\", na = \"-999\")\n\nThese different versions respect the different ways in which the .dat and .csv file formats work. We need read_tsv() when data files consist of tab separated values. We need read_csv() when data files consist of comma separated values.\nYou can read more about the {tidyverse} {readr} library of helpful functions here\nIt is very common to get experimental data in all sorts of different formats. Learning to use tidyverse functions will make it easier to cope with this when you do research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe use the read_ function to read in the data\n\nentering (here, at least) arguments – inside the brackets after the function name – to tell R what file we need and how missing values (NAs) are coded.\n\n\n\nIt will help your understanding to examine an example. Take a look at what this line of code includes, element by element.\n\nbehaviour.rt &lt;- read_tsv(\"CP study word naming rt 180211.dat\", na = \"-999\")\n\n\nWe write behaviour.rt &lt;- read_tsv(...) to create an object in the R environment, which we call behaviour.rt: the object with this name is the data-set we read into R using read_tsv(...).\nWhen we write the function read_tsv(...) we include two arguments inside it.\nread_tsv(\"CP study word naming rt 180211.dat\", ... first, the name of the file, given in quotes \"\" and then a comma.\nread_tsv(..., na = \"-999\") second, we tell R that there are some missing values na which are coded with the value \"-999\".\n\n\n\n\nIn the data-sets – typically, the spreadsheets – we create in our research, we will have values missing for different reasons. Take another look at the data spreadsheet you saw earlier, Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn R, a missing value is said to be “not available”: NA.\n\n\nYou should be able to see that the spreadsheet holds information, as explained, about the RTs of the responses made by each child to each stimulus word. Each of the cells in the spreadsheet (i.e. the box where a column intersects with a row) includes a number value. Most of the values are positive numbers like 751.3: the reaction time of a response, recorded in milliseconds. The values have to be positive because they represent the length of time between the moment the stimulus word is presented on the test computer screen and the moment the child’s spoken word response has begun to be registered by the computer microphone and sound recording software.\nSome of the cells hold the value -999, however. Obviously, we cannot have negative RT. The value represents the fact that we have no data. Take a look at Figure 1: we have a -999 where we should have a RT for the response made by participant AllanaD to the word broad. This -999 is there because, for some reason, we did not record an RT or a response for that combination of participant and stimulus.\nWe can choose any value we like, as researchers, to code for missing data like this. Some researchers choose not to code for the absence of a response recording or leave the cell in a spreadsheet blank or empty where data are missing. This is bad practice though it is common.\nThere are a number of reasons why it is bad practice to just leave a cell empty when it is empty because no observation is to be recorded.\n\nData may be missing for different reasons: maybe a child did not make any response to a stimulus (often called a “null response”); or maybe a child made a response but there was a microphone or other technical fault; or maybe a child made a response but it was an error and (here) the corresponding performance measure (RT) cannot be counted.\nIf you do not code for missingness in the data then the software you use will do it for you, but you may not know how it does so, or where.\nIf you have missing data, you ought to be able to identify where the data are missing.\n\nI use -999 to code for missing values because you should never see a value like that in real reading RT data. You can use whatever value you like but you should make sure you do code for missing data somehow.\n\n\n\nWe are going to need to restructure these data from a wide format to a longer format. We need to restructure both behavioural data-sets, accuracy and RT. We do this using the pivot_longer() function.\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n             pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\nacc.long &lt;- behaviour.acc %&gt;%\n              pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"accuracy\")\n\nResearchers used to have to do this sort of thing by hand, using copying and pasting, in Excel or SPSS. Doing the process by hand takes many hours or days. And you always make errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDoing data-set construction programmatically, using R functions, is generally faster and more reliable than doing it by hand.\n\n\nHere, we use a function you may have seen before: pivot_longer(). It will help your understanding to examine the code carefully.\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n             pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\nThe name of the function comes from the fact that we are starting with data in wide format e.g. behaviour.rt where we have what should be a single variable of observations (RTs) arranged in a wide series of multiple columns, side-by-side (one column for each participant). But we want to take those wide data and lengthen the data-set, increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.\nLet’s look at this line of code bit by bit. It includes a powerful function that accomplishes a lot of tasks, so it is worth explaining this function in some detail.\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n\n\nAt the start, I tell R that I am going to create a new longer data-set (more rows, fewer columns) that I shall call rt.long.\nI will create this longer data-set from &lt;- the original wide data-set behaviour.rt.\nand I will create the new longer data-set by taking the original wide data-set and piping it %&gt;% to the pivot function coded on the next line:\n\n\npivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\n\nOn this next line, I tell R how to do the pivoting by using three arguments.\n\n\npivot_longer(2:62...)\n\n\nFirst, I tell R that I want to re-arrange all the columns that can be found in the data-set from the second column to the sixty-second column.\nIn a spreadsheet, we have a number of columns.\nColumns can be identified by their position in the spreadsheet.\nThe position of a column in a spreadsheet can be identified by number, from the leftmost column (column number 1) to the rightmost column (here, column number 62) in our data-set.\nSo this argument tells R exactly which columns I want to pivot.\n\n\npivot_longer(..., names_to = \"subjectID\", ...)\n\n\nSecond, I tell R that I want it to take the column labels and put them into a new column, called subjectID.\nIn the wide data-set behaviour.rt, each column holds a list of numbers (RTs) but begins with a word in the topmost cell, the name code for a participant, in the column label position.\nWe want to keep the information about which participant produces which response when we pivot the wide data to a longer structure.\nWe do this by asking R to take the column labels (the participant names) and listing them in a new column, called subjectID which now holds the names as participant ID codes.\n\n\npivot_longer(...values_to = \"RT\")\n\n\nThird, we tell R that all the RT values should be put in a single column.\nWe can understand that this new column RT will hold RT observations in a vertical stack, one cell for each response by a person to a word, with rows ordered by subjectID.\n\nThere are 61 columns of data listed by participant though 62 children were tested because we lost one child’s data through an administrative error. As a result, in the wide data sets there are 62 columns, with the first column holding item_name data.\nYou can find more information about pivoting data here\nAnd you can find more information specifically about the pivot_longer() operation here\n\n\n\nAs I noted, one problem with the wide format is that the data are structured so that the column names are not names of variables. In our example wide format data-set, behaviour.rt, the columns are headed by a participant identity code or name but a participant code is not the name of a variable, it is a value of the variable I call subjectID.\nIn the design of the CP reading study, we want to take into account the impact of differences between participants on response RT (so, we need to identify which participant makes which response). But we do not see the responses made by a participant as a predictor variable.\nA second problem is that, in a wide format file like behaviour.rt, information about the responses made to each stimulus word is all on the same row (that seems good) but in different columns. Each person responded to all the words. But the response made to a word e.g. act made by one participant is in a different column (e.g., 594.8ms, for AislingoC) from the response made to the same word by a different participant (e.g., 586ms, for AlexB). This means that information about the responses made to each stimulus word are spread out as values across multiple columns.\nYou can see this for yourself if you inspect the source rt data using head() to view the top four rows of the data-set.\n\n\n\n\n\nitem_name\nAislingoC\nAlexB\nAllanaD\nAmyR\nAndyD\nAnnaF\nAoifeH\nChloeBergin\nChloeF\nChloeS\nCianR\nConorF\nDavidL\nDillonF\nDJHerlihy\nEamonD\nEimearK\nEllenH\nEoinL\nGrainneH\nJackBr\nJackK\nJackS\nJamesoC\nJenniferoS\nKateF\nKayleighMc\nKenW\nKevinL\nKieranF\nKillianB\nKirstyC\nLeeJ\nMarkC\nMatthewC\nMeganoB\nMichaelaoD\nNataliaR\nNiallG\nNiallGavin\nNiallW\nOisinN\nOlaA\nOwenD\nPalomaM\nPauricT\nPerryD\nRachelD\nRebeccaGr\nRebeccaM\nRebeccaR\nRoisinF\nRonanT\nSarahP\nShaunaBr\nSiobhanR\nTaraB\nTeeTeeOj\nThomasK\nTristianT\nZainab\n\n\n\n\nact\n594.8\n586.0\nNA\n693.0\n597\n627.0\n649.0\n1081.0\n642.0\n622.7\n701.0\n686.0\n951.0\n661.0\n692.0\n670.0\n502.4\n578.4\n651.8\n441.6\n895.2\n529.0\n639.0\n809\n676.9\n568.8\n586.1\n591.3\n587\n586\n723.9\n1428.0\n557.0\n639.4\n676\n714.8\n623.3\n615.0\n796.0\n568.4\n800.9\n595\nNA\n574.9\n628\n797.0\n652\n757.0\n631.0\n520.5\n640.0\n733.0\n566\n758.0\n670.0\n532.4\n615.7\n540.0\n1390.0\n747\n651.0\n\n\nask\n481.5\n864.0\n1163.0\n694.4\n616\n631.0\n538.0\n799.3\n603.0\n526.0\n591.5\n699.6\n827.2\n635.0\n654.0\n508.0\n564.0\n822.0\n479.7\n600.0\n617.6\n555.9\n654.6\n765\n856.0\n576.7\n690.3\n501.9\n634\n626\n523.3\n640.7\n516.0\n625.7\n561\n698.2\n685.0\n606.0\n793.0\n551.9\n668.7\n722\n868.0\n633.0\n578\n660.2\n851\n640.3\n630.0\n535.0\n568.0\n579.7\n562\n747.0\n602.4\n558.4\n691.0\n580.8\n590.9\n795\n740.5\n\n\nboth\n457.5\n670.0\n1114.3\n980.0\n1019\n796.1\n545.2\nNA\n581.0\n568.4\n665.0\n751.0\n917.0\n808.1\n737.6\n597.0\n475.0\n608.0\n699.2\n600.6\n527.3\n601.0\n982.1\n917\n854.4\n571.6\n825.3\n584.0\n720\n571\n624.0\n853.4\nNA\n703.0\n781\n1065.8\n591.5\n559.2\n837.6\n612.0\n743.4\n743\n919.0\n883.0\n616\n734.6\n658\n574.4\n634.9\n559.7\n689.0\n997.8\n648\n753.4\n548.0\n530.5\n625.4\n552.0\n985.0\n640\n764.0\n\n\nbox\n546.0\n748.6\n975.0\n678.0\n589\n604.0\n574.0\n658.0\n688.7\n492.0\n641.0\n699.0\n824.0\n731.6\n634.0\n557.5\n520.1\n581.0\n1191.0\n612.0\n540.0\n540.0\n810.0\n885\n573.8\n614.9\n722.0\n594.6\n632\n549\n564.0\n632.6\n668.6\n627.0\n577\n785.9\n649.0\n616.0\n928.0\n608.7\n690.0\n857\n886.6\n544.0\n863\n726.0\n812\n640.5\n613.8\n395.1\n656.7\n604.7\n530\n667.4\n547.7\n570.0\n585.6\n532.0\n634.0\n764\n912.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis structure is a problem for visualization and for analysis because the functions we will use require us to specify single columns for an outcome variable like reaction time.\nWe are looking at the process of tidying data because untidiness is very common. Learning how to deal with it will save you a lot of time and grief later.\nYou should check for yourself how subjectID and RT or accuracy scores get transposed from the old wide structure to the new long structure.\n\n# RT data\nhead(behaviour.rt)\nhead(rt.long)\n\n# accuracy data\nhead(behaviour.acc)\nhead(acc.long)\n\nIf you compare the rt.long or acc.long data with the data in the original wide format then you can see how – in going from wide – we have re-arranged the data to a longer and narrower set of columns:\n\none column listing each word;\none column for subjectID;\nand one column for RT or accuracy.\n\nWhat a check will show you is that we have multiple rows for responses to each item so that the item is repeated multiple times in different rows.\nThese data are now tidy.\n\nEach column has information about one variable\nAnd each row has information about one observation, here, the response made by a participant to a word\n\nThis is a big part of data tidying now done. However, these data are incomplete. Next we shall combine behavioural observations with data about stimulus words and about participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer our research question, we next need to combine the RT with the accuracy data, and then the combined behavioural data with participant information and stimulus information. This is because, as we have seen, information about behavioural responses, about participant attributes or stimulus word properties, are located in separate files.\nMany researchers have completed this kind of operation by hand. This involves copying and pasting bits of data in a spreadsheet. It can take hours or days. I know because I have done it, and I have seen others do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nPlease do not try to combine data-sets through manual operations e.g. in Excel. I guarantee that:\n\nYou will make mistakes.\nYou will not know when or where those mistakes are in your data.\n\nThere are better ways to spend your time.\n\n\nWe can combine the data-sets, in the way that we need, using the {tidyverse} full_join() function. This gets the job done quickly, and accurately.\nFirst, we join RT and accuracy data together.\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;% \n          full_join(acc.long)\n\nThen, we join subject and item information to the behavioural data.\n\nlong.subjects &lt;- long %&gt;% \n                   full_join(subjects, by = \"subjectID\")\n\nlong.all &lt;- long.subjects %&gt;%\n              full_join(words, by = \"item_name\")\n\nNotice, we can let R figure out how to join the pieces of data together. If we were doing this by hand then we would need to check very carefully the correspondences between observations in different data-sets.\nHere, in a series of steps, we take one data-set and join it (merge it) with the second data-set. Let’s look at an example element by element to better understand how this is accomplished.\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;% \n           full_join(acc.long)\n\nThe code work as follows.\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;%\n\n\nWe create a new data-set we call long.\nWe do this by taking one original data-set rt.long and %&gt;% piping it to the operation defined in the second step.\n\n\nfull_join(acc.long)\n\n\nIn this second step, we use the function full_join() to add observations from a second original data-set acc.long to those already from rt.long\n\nThe addition of observations from one database joining to those from another happens through a matching process.\n\nR looks at the data-sets being merged.\nIt identifies if the two data-sets have columns in common. Here, the data-sets have subjectID and item_name in common).\nR can use these common columns to identify rows of data. Here, each row of data will be identified by both subjectID and item_name i.e. as data about the response made by a participant to a word.\nR will then do a series of identity checks, comparing one data-set with the other and, row by row, looking for matching values in the columns that are common to both data-sets.\nIf there is a match then R joins the corresponding rows of data together.\nIf there isn’t a match then it creates NAs where there are missing entries in one row for one data-set which cannot be matched to a row from the joining data-set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that in one example, the example of code I discuss here, I did not specify identifying columns in common, allowing the function to do the work. In the other code chunks I did: long.all &lt;- long.subjects %&gt;% full_join(words, by = \"item_name\") using the by = ... argument.\n\nSometimes, you can vary in how you employ a _join() function.\nIt may help to specify the identifying column if you want to make explicit (to yourselves and others) how the process is to be completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the {tidyverse} family of dplyr functions, when you work with multiple data-sets (tables of data), we call the data-sets relational data.\nThere are three families of functions (like verbs) designed to work with relational data:\n\nMutating joins, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.\nFiltering joins, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.\nSet operations, which treat observations as if they were set elements.\n\nWe can connect data-sets – relate them – according to shared variables like subjectID, item_name (for our data). In {tidyverse}, the variables that connect pairs of tables are called keys where, and this is what counts, key(-s) are variable(-s) that uniquely identify an observation.\nFor the experimental reading data, we have observations about each response made by a participant (one of 61 subjects) to an item (one of 160 words). For these data, we can match up a pair of RT and accuracy observations for each (unique) subjectID-item_name combination. If you reflect, we could not combine the RT and accuracy data correctly if we did not have both identifying variables in both data-sets, because both column variables are required to uniquely identify each observation.\nFurther, we could not combine the RT and accuracy data correctly if there were mismatches in values of the identifying variable. Sometimes, I have done this operation and it has gone wrong because a subjectID has been spelled one way in one data-set e.g. hugh and another way in the other data-set e.g. HughH. This leads me to share some advice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nBe careful about spelling identifiers.\nAlways check your work after merger operations.\n\nYou can check your work by calculating data-set lengths to ensure the number of rows in the new data-set matches your expectations, given the study design and data collection procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used the full_join() function.\nThere are three kinds of joins.\n\nA left join keeps all observations in x.\nA right join keeps all observations in y.\nA full join keeps all observations in x and y.\n\nI used full_join() because I wanted to retain all observations from both data-sets, whether there was a match (as assumed) or not, in the identifying variables, between observations in each data-set.\n\n\n\n\nBreak the join: You can examine how the full_join() works by experimenting with stopping it from working.\n\nAs I discuss, you need to have matches in values on key (common) variables. If the subjectID is different on different data-sets, you will lose data that would otherwise be merged to form the merged or composite data-set.\nCheck what happens if you deliberately misspell one of the subjectID values in one of the original source wide behavioural data files.\nTo be safe, you might want to do this exercise with copies of the source files kept in a folder you create for this purpose. If it goes wrong, you can always re-access the source files and read them in again.\nYou can check what happens before and after you break the match by counting the number of rows in the data-set that results from the merger. We can count the number of rows in a data-set with:\n\nlength(long.all$RT)\n\n[1] 9762\n\n\nThis bit of code takes the length of the vector (i.e. variable column RT in data-set long.all), thus counting the number of rows in the data-set.\n\n\n\n\nOK, now we have all the data about everything all in one big, long and wide, data-set. But we do not actually require all of the data-set for the analyses we are going to do.\nWe next need to do two things. First, we need to get rid of variables we will not use: we do that by using select(). Then, we need to remove errors and outlying short RT observations: we do that by using filter() in Section Section 1.7.7.\nWe are going to select just the variables we need using the select() function.\n\nlong.all.select &lt;- long.all %&gt;% \n                        select(item_name, subjectID, RT, accuracy, \n                               Lg.UK.CDcount, brookesIMG, AoA_Kup_lem, \n                               Ortho_N, regularity, Length, BG_Mean, \n                               Voice,   Nasal,  Fricative,  Liquid_SV,\n                               Bilabials,   Labiodentals,   Alveolars,\n                               Palatals,    Velars, Glottals, \n                               age.months, TOWREW_skill, TOWRENW_skill, \n                               spoonerisms, CART_score)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that these variables do not have reader-friendly names: but naming things is important.\n\nCheck out the ever-useful Jenny Bryan’s advice.\n\n\n\nThe names we have in the CP study data were fine for internal use within my research group but we should be careful to ensure that variables have names that make sense to others and to our future selves. We can adjust variable names using the rename() function but I will leave that as an exercise for you to do.\n\n\n\nSelect different variables: You could analyze the CP study data for a research report.\n\nWhat if you wanted to analyze a different set of variables, could you select different variables?\n\n\n\n\nWe now have a tidy data-set long.all.select with 26 columns and 9762 rows.\nThe data-set includes missing values, designated NA. Here, every error (coded 0, in accuracy) corresponds to an NA in the RT column.\nThe data-set also includes outlier data. In this context, \\(RT &lt; 200\\) are probably response errors or equipment failures. We will want to analyse accuracy later, so we shall need to be careful about getting rid of NAs.\nAt this point, I am going to exclude two sets of observations only.\n\nobservations corresponding to correct response reaction times that are too short: \\(RT &lt; 200\\).\nplus observations corresponding to the word false which (because of stupid Excel auto-formatting) dropped item attribute data.\n\nWe can do this using the filter() function, setting conditions on rows, as arguments.\n\n# step 1\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select %&gt;% \n                            filter(item_name != 'FALSE')\n\n# step 2\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select.filter %&gt;%\n                            filter(RT &gt;= 200)\n\nHere, I am using the function filter() to …\n\nCreate a new data-set long.all.select.filter &lt;- ... by\nUsing functions to work on the data named immediately to the right of the assignment arrow: long.all.select\nAn observation is included in the new data-set if it matches the condition specified as an argument in the filter() function call, thus:\n\n\nfilter(item_name !='FALSE') means: include in the new data-set long.all.select.filter all observations from the old data-set long.all.select that are not != (! not = equal to) the value FALSE in the variable item_name,\nthen recreate the long.all.select.filter as a version of itself (with no name change) by including in the new version only those observations where RT was greater than or equal to 200ms using RT &gt;= 200.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe difference between = and ==\nYou need to be careful to distinguish these signs.\n\n= assigns a value, so x = 2 means “x equals 2”\n== tests a match so x == 2 means: “is x equal to 2?”\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can supply multiple arguments to filter() and this may be helpful if (1.) you want to filter observations according to a match on condition-A and condition-B (logical “and” is coded with &) or (2.) you want to filter observations according to a match on condition-A or condition-B (logical “or” is coded |).\nYou can read more about using multiple arguments to filter observations here.\n\n\n\n\nVary the filter conditions: in different ways\n\n\nChange the threshold for including RTs from RT &gt;= 200 to something else\nCan you assess what impact the change has? Note that you can count the number of observations (rows) in a data-set using e.g. length(data.set.name$variable.name)\n\nFiltering or re-coding observations is an important element of the research workflow in psychological science, as I examine in the discussion of data multiverse analyses here. How we do or do not remove observations from original data may have an impact on our results (as explored by, e.g., Steegen et al., 2014). It is important, therefore, that we learn how to do this reproducibly using R scripts that we can share with our research reports.\nYou can read further information about filtering here.\n\n\n\n\nWe will be working with the long.all.select.filter.csv data-set collated from the experimental, subject ability scores, and item property data collected for the CP word naming study.\nFor convenience, I am going to remove missing values before we go any further, using the na.omit() function.\n\nlong.all.noNAs &lt;- na.omit(long.all.select.filter)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe na.omit() function is powerful.\n\nIn using this function, I am asking R to create a new data-set long.all.noNAs from the old data-set long.all.select.filter in a process in which the new data-set will have no rows in which there is a missing value NA in any column.\nYou need to be reasonably sure, when you use this function, where your NAs may be because, otherwise, you may end the process with a new filtered data-set that has many fewer rows in it than you expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhead(long.all.noNAs, n = 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 26\n   item_name subjectID      RT accuracy Lg.UK.CDcount brookesIMG AoA_Kup_lem\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 act       AislingoC    595.        1          4.03          4        6.42\n 2 act       AlexB        586         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 3 act       AmyR         693         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 4 act       AndyD        597         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 5 act       AnnaF        627         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 6 act       AoifeH       649         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 7 act       ChloeBergin 1081         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 8 act       ChloeF       642         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 9 act       ChloeS       623.        1          4.03          4        6.42\n10 act       CianR        701         1          4.03          4        6.42\n# ℹ 19 more variables: Ortho_N &lt;dbl&gt;, regularity &lt;dbl&gt;, Length &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   BG_Mean &lt;dbl&gt;, Voice &lt;dbl&gt;, Nasal &lt;dbl&gt;, Fricative &lt;dbl&gt;, Liquid_SV &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Bilabials &lt;dbl&gt;, Labiodentals &lt;dbl&gt;, Alveolars &lt;dbl&gt;, Palatals &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Velars &lt;dbl&gt;, Glottals &lt;dbl&gt;, age.months &lt;dbl&gt;, TOWREW_skill &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   TOWRENW_skill &lt;dbl&gt;, spoonerisms &lt;dbl&gt;, CART_score &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nIf we inspect long.all.noNAs, we can see that we have now got a tidy data-set with all the data we need for our analyses:\n\nOne observation per row, corresponding to data about a response made by a participant to a stimulus in an experimental trial\nOne variable per column\nWe have information about the speed and accuracy of responses\nAnd we have information about the children and about the words.\n\nWe have removed the missing values and we have filtered outliers.\n\n\n\nHaving produced the tidy data-set, we may wish to share it, or save ourselves the trouble of going through the process again. We can do this by creating a .csv file.\n\nwrite_csv(long.all.noNAs, \"long.all.noNAs.csv\")\n\nThis function will create a .csv file from the data-set you name long.all.noNAs which R will put in your working directory.\n\n\n\nMost research work involving quantitative evidence requires a big chunk of data tidying or processing before you get to the statistics. Most of the time, this is work you will have to do. The lessons you can learn about the process will generalize to many future research scenarios.\n\nIt is a mistake to think of data tidying or wrangling as an inconvenience or as an extra task or something you need to do to get to the ‘good stuff’ (your results).\n\nAll analysis results follow from and thus are determined by the data processing steps that precede analysis.\nAnalysis results can and do vary, perhaps critically, depending on different processing decisions, and reasonable people may differ on key processing decisions.\nThe process of data tidying is frequently instructive of your data recording quality: you find things out about your field measurements or your instrument integrity or quality of your recordings, when you pay attention, when you process your data.\n\n\nIt is wise to see data tidying or processing as a key part of the data analysis workflow because, as I examine in the data multiverse discussion here, the choices you make or the integrity or quality of the actions you take, will have consequences for your analysis results or, more generally, for the quality of the evidence you share with others.\nHere is a nice substack post that links to some scholarly writing and makes some excellent points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA key recommendation is that you write code to tidy or process data, thus creating a self-documented auditable data tidying process in your analysis workflow.\n\nThis is simple to do in R and that is one important reason why we use and teach R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur focus in this chapter is on analyzing data that come from studies with repeated-measures designs where the experimenter presents multiple stimuli for response to each participant.\nIn our working example, the CP reading study, CP asked all participants in her study to read a selection of words. All participants read the same selection of words, and every person read every word. For each participant, we have multiple observations and these (within-participant) observations will not be independent of each other. One participant will tend to be slower or less accurate compared to another participant, on average. Likewise, one participant’s responses will reveal a stronger (or weaker) impact of the effect of an experimental variable than another participant. These between-participant differences will tend to be apparent across the sample of participants.\nYou could say that the lowest trial-level observations can be grouped with respect to participants, that observations are nested within participant. But the data can also be grouped by stimuli. Remember that in the CP study, all participants read the same selection of words, and every person read every word. This means that for each stimulus word, there are multiple observations because all participants responded to each word, and these (within-item) observations will not be independent of each other. One word may prove to be more challenging compared to another, eliciting slower or less accurate responses, on average. Likewise, participants’ responses to a word will reveal a stronger (or weaker) impact of the effect of an experimental variable than the responses to another word. Again, these between-stimulus differences will tend to be apparent when you examine observations of responses across the sample of words.\nUnder these circumstances, are observations about the responses made by different participants nested under words, or are observations about the responses to different words nested under participants? We do not have to make a decision.\nGiven this common repeated-measures design, we can analyze the outcome variable in relation to:\n\nfixed effects: the impact of independent variables like participant reading skill or word frequency\nrandom effects: the impact of random or unexplained differences between participants and also between stimuli\n\nIn this situation, we can say that the random effects are crossed (Baayen et al., 2008). When multilevel models require the specification of crossed random effects, they tend to be called mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate the approach, we examine observations from the CP study. We begin, as we did previously, by ignoring differences due to grouping variables (like participant or stimulus). We pretend that all observations are independent. In this fantasy situation, we address our research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: What word properties influence responses to words in a test of reading aloud?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not completed the process of tidying the CP study data then you can import the pre-tidied data here.\n\nlong.all.noNAs &lt;- read_csv(\"long.all.noNAs.csv\", \n                  col_types = cols(\n                    subjectID = col_factor(),\n                    item_name = col_factor()\n                    )\n                  ) \n\nNotice that I am using read_csv() with an additional argument col_types = cols(...).\n\nHere, I am requesting that read_csv() treats subjectID and item_name as factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe can use col_types = cols(...) to control how read_csv() interprets specific column variables in the data.\n\n\nControlling the way that read_csv() handles variables is a very useful capacity, and a more efficient way to work than, say, first reading in the data and then using coercion to ensure that variables are assigned appropriate types. You can read more about it here.\n\n\n\nWe begin our data analysis by asking if reading reaction time (RT) varies in association with word frequency. A scatterplot shows that response latencies decrease with increasing word frequency (Figure 2).\n\nlong.all.noNAs %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = Lg.UK.CDcount, y = RT)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .2) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, size = 1.5, colour=\"red\") + \n  theme_bw() + \n  xlab(\"Word frequency: log context distinctiveness (CD) count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Reading reaction time compared to word frequency, all data\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot, we see that the best fit line drawn with geom_smooth() trends downward for higher values of word frequency. This means that Figure 2 suggests that RT decreases with increasing word frequency. (I know there is a weird looking line of points around 0 but we can ignore that here.)\nWe can estimate the relationship between RT and word frequency using a linear model in which we ignore the possibility that there may be differences (between subjects, or between items) in the intercept or (between subjects) in the slope of the frequency effect. This simplified model can be stated as:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_j + e_{ij}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Y_{ij}\\) is the value of the observed outcome variable, the RT of the response made by the \\(i\\) participant to the \\(j\\) word;\n\\(\\beta_1X_j\\) refers to the fixed effect of the explanatory variable (here, word frequency), where the frequency value \\(X_j\\) is different for different words \\(j\\), and \\(\\beta_1\\) is the estimated coefficient of the effect due to the relationship between response RT and word frequency;\n\\(e_{ij}\\) is the residual error term, representing the differences between observed \\(Y_{ij}\\) and predicted values (given the model).\n\nThe linear model can be fit in R using the lm() function, as we have done previously.\n\n# label: lm-all-freq\nlm.all.1 &lt;- lm(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount, data = long.all.noNAs)\n\nsummary(lm.all.1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = RT ~ Lg.UK.CDcount, data = long.all.noNAs)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-346.62 -116.03  -38.37   62.05 1981.58 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

This means that, according to the linear model, RT decreases by about 53 milliseconds for each unit increase in log word frequency.\n\n\n\nNotice that, here, word frequency information is located in the Lg.UK.CDcount variable. In a common move for reading data analyses, we transformed the frequency estimate to the Log base 10 of the word frequency values, prior to analysis, in part because word frequency estimates are usually highly skewed.\nThe model does not explain much variance, as \\(Adjusted \\space R^2 = .03\\) but, no doubt due to the large sample, the regression model is significant overall \\(F(1,9083) = 302.8, p &lt; .001\\).\n\n\n\nVary the linear model: using different outcomes or different predictor variables.\n\nThe CP study data-set is rich with possibility. It would be useful to experiment with it.\n\nChange the predictor from frequency to something else: what do you see when you visualize the relationship between variables using scatterplots?\nSpecify linear models with different predictors: do the relationships you see in plots match the coefficients you see in the model estimates?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is that, as we have discussed, we assume that observations are independent for the linear model yet we can suppose in advance that that assumption of independence will be questionable given the expectation that participants’ responses will differ in predictable ways: one participant’s responses will perhaps be slower or less accurate than another, perhaps more or less affected by word frequency than another.\nWe can examine that variation by estimating the intercept and the slope of the frequency effect separately using the data for each participant alone. We can start by visualizing the frequency effect for each child in a grid of plots, with each plot representing the \\(\\text{RT} \\sim \\text{frequency}\\) relationship for the data for a child (Figure 3).\nWe looked at how the plotting code works step-by-step in the conceptual introduction to multilevel data.\n\nlong.all.noNAs %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Lg.UK.CDcount, y = RT)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = .2) + \n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, size = 1.25, colour = \"red\") + \n    theme_bw() + \n    xlab(\"Word frequency (log10 UK SUBTLEX CD count)\") + \n    facet_wrap(~ subjectID)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: RT vs. word frequency, considered separately for data for each child\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows how, on average, more frequent words are associated with shorter reaction time: faster responses. The plot further shows, however, that the effect of frequency varies considerably between children.\n\nSome children show little or no effect; the best fit line is practically level.\nSome children show a marked effect, with a steep fit line indicating a strong frequency effect.\n\nWe can get more insight into the differences between children if we plot the estimated intercept and frequency effect coefficients for each child directly. This allows more insight because it focuses the eye on the differences between children in the estimates. We do this next: see Figure 4. (I work through the code for generating the plot in: 02-mixed-workbook-with-answers.R)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Estimated intercepts and frequency effect slopes calculated for each child’s data, with child data analysed separately for all children. Points represent estimates. Lines represent standard errors for estimates. Point estimates are presented in order of size.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 presents two plots showing the estimates of the intercept and the coefficient of the effect of word frequency on reading RT, calculated separately for each child. This means that we fitted a separate linear model, for the association between RT and frequency, using the data for just one child, for each child in our sample, for all the children.\nThe estimate for each child is shown as a black dot. The standard error of the estimate is shown as a black vertical line, shown above and below a point. You can say that where there is a longer line there we have more uncertainty about the location of the estimate.\nThe estimates calculated for each child are shown ordered from left to right in the plot by the size of the estimate. This adjustment to the plot reveals how the estimates of both the intercept and the slope of the frequency effect vary substantially between children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe first key observation is that if there is an average intercept for everyone in the sample or, better, an intercept we could estimate for everyone in the population, then the different intercepts we have estimated for each child would be distributed around that population-level average:\n\nSome children will have slower (here, larger) intercepts\nand other children will have faster (shorter) intercepts.\n\n\n\nHere, the intercept can be taken to be the average RT when all other effects in the model are set to zero. RT varies for this sample around somewhere like \\(\\beta_0 = 883ms\\) so a slower larger intercept might be e.g. \\(\\beta_0 = 1000ms\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe second key observation is that if there is an average slope for the frequency effect, an effect of frequency on reading RT, averaged across everyone in the population, then, again, the different slopes we have estimated for each child would be distributed around that population-level effect.\n\nSome children will have larger (here, more negative) frequency effects\nand other children will have smaller (less negative) frequency effects.\n\n\n\nHere, the frequency effect is associated with a negative coefficient e.g. \\(\\beta_1 = -53\\) so a larger frequency effect will be a bigger negative number e.g. \\(\\beta_1 = -100\\).\n\n\n\nIn a mixed-effects model, we account for this variation: the differences between participants in intercepts and slopes.\nWe do this by modeling the intercept as two terms:\n\\[\n\\beta_{0i} = \\gamma_0 + U_{0i}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma_0\\) is the average intercept and \\(U_{0i}\\) is the difference for each \\(i\\) child between their intercept and the average intercept.\n\nWe model the frequency effect as two terms:\n\\[\n\\beta_{1i} = \\gamma_1 + U_{1i}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma_1\\) is the average slope and \\(U_{1i}\\) represents the difference for each \\(i\\) child between the slope of their frequency effect and the average slope.\n\nWe can then incorporate in a single model the fixed effects due to the average intercept and the average frequency effect, as well as the random effects, error variance due to unexplained differences between participants in intercepts and frequency effects:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1X_j + U_{0i}+ U_{1i}X_j + e_{ij}\n\\]\n\nwhere the outcome \\(Y_{ij}\\) is related to …\nthe average intercept \\(\\gamma_0\\) and differences between \\(i\\) children in the intercept \\(U_{0i}\\);\nthe average effect of the explanatory variable frequency \\(\\gamma_1X_j\\) and differences between \\(i\\) participants in the slope \\(U_{1i}X_j\\);\nin addition to residual error variance \\(e_{ij}\\).\n\n\n\nIn sections Section 1.9.7 and Section 1.11, we look at what exactly is captured in these random effects terms \\(U_{0i}, U_{1i}\\). Let’s first look at the practicalities of analysis then come back to deepen our understanding a bit more.\nRight now, it is important to understand that in our analysis we do not care about the differences between specific children. We care that there are differences. And we care how widely spread are the differences between child A and the average intercept (or slope), or between child B and the average intercept (or slope), or between child C … (you get the idea). Therefore, in our analysis, we estimate the spread of the differences as a variance term. We can see this when we look at the results of the mixed-effects model we specify, next.\n\n\n\n\nWe can fit a mixed-effects model of the \\(\\text{RT} \\sim \\text{frequency}\\) relationship, taking into account the random differences between participants. I first go through the model fitting code bit by bit. (I go through the output, the results, in Section 1.9.6.)\n\nlmer.all.1 &lt;- lmer(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + \n                         (Lg.UK.CDcount + 1||subjectID),\n             \n             data = long.all.noNAs)\n\nsummary(lmer.all.1)\n\nYou have seen the lmer() function code before but practice makes perfect so we shall go through the code step by step, as we did previously.\nFirst, we have a chunk of code mostly similar to what we do when we do a regression analysis.\n\nlmer.all.1 &lt;- lmer(...) creates a linear mixed-effects model object using the lmer() function.\nRT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount is a formula expressing the model in which we estimate the fixed effect on the outcome or dependent variable RT (reaction time, in milliseconds) as predicted \\(\\sim\\) by the independent or predictor variable Lg.UK.CDcount (word frequency).\n...(..., data = long.all.noNAs) specifies the data-set in which you can find the variables named in the model fitting code.\nsummary(lmer.all.1) gets a summary of the fitted model object, showing you the results.\n\nSecond, we have the bit that is specific to multilevel or mixed-effects models.\n\nWe add (...||subjectID) to tell R about the random effects corresponding to random differences between sample groups (here, observations grouped by child) that are coded by the subjectID variable.\n(...1 ||subjectID) says that we want to estimate random differences between sample groups (observations by child) in intercepts, where the intercept is coded by 1.\n(Lg.UK.CDcount... ||subjectID) adds random differences between sample groups (observations by child) in slopes of the frequency effect coded using the Lg.UK.CDcount variable name.\n\n\n\nIt will help your learning if you now go back and compare this model with the model you saw in the conceptual introduction to multilevel data.\n\nIdentify what is different: data-set, variable names, and model formula.\nIdentify what stays the same: function name … the specification of both model and random effects.\n\nIf you can see what is different versus what stays the same then you learn what you can change when the time comes for your analysis with your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLearning to look at example code so that you can identify how to adapt it for your own purposes is a key skill in psychological data science.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we move on, I want you to notice something that looks like nothing much: ||.\nWe are going to need to defer until later a (necessary) discussion of exactly why we need the two double lines. In short, the use of || asks R to fit a model in which we estimate random effects associated with:\n\nvariance due to differences in intercepts\nvariance due to differences in slopes\nbut not covariance between the two sets of differences\n\nI do this because otherwise the model I specify will not converge.\nWe shall need to discuss these things: convergence, and failures to converge; as well as random effects specification and simplification. We will discuss random effects covariance in Section 1.11. For now, the most important lesson is learnt by seeing how the analysis approach we saw last week can be extended to examining the effects of experimental variables in data from repeated measures design studies.\n\n\n\n\nThe lmer() model code we discussed in Section 1.9.5 gives us the following output.\n\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: RT ~ Lg.UK.CDcount + ((1 | subjectID) + (0 + Lg.UK.CDcount |  \n    subjectID))\n   Data: long.all.noNAs\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 117805.3\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.7839 -0.5568 -0.1659  0.3040 12.4850 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups      Name          Variance Std.Dev.\n subjectID   (Intercept)   87575    295.93  \n subjectID.1 Lg.UK.CDcount  2657     51.55  \n Residual                  23734    154.06  \nNumber of obs: 9085, groups:  subjectID, 61\n\nFixed effects:\n              Estimate Std.

We expand on that discussion, a little, here.\nThe output from the model summary first gives us information about the model.\n\nFirst, we see information about the function used to fit the model, and the model object created by the lmer() function call.\nThen, we see the model formula RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + (Lg.UK.CDcount + 1|subjectID).\nThen, we see REML criterion at convergence about the model fitting process, which we can usually ignore.\nThen, we see information about the distribution of the model residuals.\nWe then see information listed under Random effects: this is where you can see information about the error variance terms estimated by the model.\n\n\nThe information is listed in four columns: 1. Groups; 2. Name; 3. Variance; and 4. Std.Dev.\n\nWe have discussed how observations can be grouped by participant (because we have multiple response observations for each person in the study) just as previously we identified how observations could be grouped by class (because we saw that children were nested under class). That is what we mean when we refer to Groups: we are identifying the grouping variables that give hierarchical structure to the data.\n\nThe Name lists whether the estimate we are looking at corresponds to, here, random differences between participants in intercepts (listed as (Intercept)), or in slopes (listed as Lg.UK.CDcount).\n\nAs we discuss later, in Section 1.11, mixed-effects models estimate the spread in random differences. We are not interested in the specific differences in intercept or slope between specific individuals. What we want is to be able to take into account the variance associated with those differences.\nThus, we see in the Random Effects section, the variances associated with:\n\nsubjectID Intercept) 87575, differences between participants in the intercepts;\nsubjectID.1 Lg.UK.CDcount 2657, differences between participants in the slopes of the frequency effect;\nAlongside Residual  23734, residuals where, just like a linear model, we have variance associated with differences between model estimates and observed RT, here, at the trial level.\n\nWe do not usually discuss the specific variance estimates in research reports. However, the relative size of the variances does provide useful information (Meteyard & Davies, 2020), as we shall see when we discuss the different estimates we get when we include a random effect due to differences between items (Section 1.10.2).\n\nLastly, we see estimates of the coefficients (of the slopes) of the fixed effects.\n\nIn this model, we see estimates of the fixed effects of the intercept and the slope of the RT ~ Lg.UK.CDcount model. We discuss these estimates next.\n\n\nRecall that the linear model yields the estimate for the frequency effect on reading RT such that RT decreases by about 53 ms for unit increase in log word frequency (\\(\\beta = -53.375\\)). Now, when we have taken random differences between participants into account, we see that the estimate of the effect for the mixed-effects model is \\(\\beta = -67.980\\). Taking into account random differences clearly has an impact on results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: What word properties influence responses to words in a test of reading aloud?\nResult: The mixed-effect analysis shows that RT decreases by about \\(68\\) milliseconds for each unit increase in log word frequency.\n\n\n\nWhich coefficient estimate should you trust? Well, it is obvious that the linear model and the linear mixed-effects model estimate are relatively similar. However, it is also obvious that the linear model makes an assumption – the assumption of independence of observations – that does not make sense theoretically (because reading responses will be similar for each child) and does not make sense empirically (because responses will differ between children, see Figure 4). Thus, we have good grounds for supposing that the linear mixed-effects model estimate for the frequency effect is likely to be closer to the true underlying population effect.\nIt is important to remember, however, that whatever estimate we can produce is the estimate given the sample of words we used, our information about word frequency, and our measurement of reading RT responses. How far our estimate actually generalizes to the wider population is not something we can judge in the context of a single study.\nFurther, we have not finished in our consideration of the random effects that the account should include. We need to do more work by thinking about the differences between stimuli (Section 1.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhy aren’t there p-values?\nWe will come back to this (in a week) but note that if \\(t &gt; 2\\) we can suppose that an effect is significant at the \\(.05\\) significance level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have said that we can incorporate, in a mixed-effects model, fixed effects (e.g., the average frequency effect) and random effects, error variance due to unexplained differences between participants in intercepts and in frequency effects:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1X_j + U_{0i}+ U_{1i}X_j + e_{ij}\n\\]\nSo we distinguish:\n\nthe average intercept \\(\\gamma_0\\) and differences between \\(i\\) children in the intercept \\(U_{0i}\\);\nthe average effect of the explanatory variable frequency \\(\\gamma_1X_j\\) and differences between \\(i\\) participants in the slope \\(U_{1i}X_j\\).\n\nWhen we think about the differences between participants (or between the units of any grouping variable), in intercepts or in slopes, we typically assume that the differences are:\n\nrandom;\nshould be normally distributed;\nand are distributed around the population or average fixed effects.\n\nWe can say that the mixed-effects model sees the differences between participants relative to the fixed effect intercept or slope, that is, relative to the population level or average effects.\nWe can illustrate this by plotting, in Figure 5, the differences as estimated – technically, predicted – by the mixed-effects model that we have been examining. (The code for producing the plot can be found in 02-mixed-workbook-answers.R.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Plot showing histograms indicating the distribution of participant adjustments to account for between-child differences in intercept or slope (the Best Linear Unbiased Predictions).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you can see in Figure 5 are distributions, presented using histograms. The centers of the distributions are located at zero (shown by a red line). For each distribution (a. and b.), that is where the model estimate of the intercept or the slope of the frequency effect is located. Spread around that central point, you see the adjustments the model makes to account for differences between participants.\nNotice how, in Figure 5 (a.):\n\nSome children have intercepts that are smaller than the population-level or average intercept – so their adjustments are negative (to decrease their intercepts).\nSome children have intercepts that are larger than the population-level or average intercept – so their adjustments are positive (to increase their intercepts).\n\n\nStrikingly, you can see that a few children have intercepts that are as much as 1000ms larger than the population-level or average intercept: the bars representing the estimates for these children are far out on the right of the x-axis in Figure 5 (a.).\n\nNow notice how, in Figure 5 (b.):\n\nSome children have frequency effects (coefficients) that are smaller than the population-level or average frequency effect – so their adjustments are positive (to decrease their frequency effect, by making it less negative).\nSome children have frequency effects that are larger than the population-level or average frequency effect – so their adjustments are negative (to increase their frequency effect, by making it more negative).\n\n(When you look at Figure 5 (b.), remember that the estimated \\(\\beta\\) coefficient for the frequency effect is negative because higher word frequency is associated with smaller RT.)\n\nStrikingly, you can see that a few children have frequency effects that are as much as 200ms larger (see plot (b.) around \\(x = -200\\)) than the population-level or average effect.\n\nWhen a mixed-effects model is fitted to a data-set, its set of estimated parameters includes the coefficients for the fixed effects as well as the standard deviations for the random effects (Baayen et al., 2008). If you read the literature on mixed-effects models, you will see that the adjustments are called Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs).\n\n\nMixed-effects modeling is hard to get used to at first. A bit more practice helps to show you how the different parts of the model work. We again focus on the random effects.\nIn the model we have seen so far, we specify (Lg.UK.CDcount + 1||subjectID)\n\nWe can change this part – and only this part – to see what happens to the results. Do it: rerun the model code, having changed the random effects part:\n\n\nlmer(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + (1|subjectID)...) gives us a random intercepts model accounting for just random differences between participants in the intercept\nlmer(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + (Lg.UK.CDcount + 0|subjectID)...) gives us a random slope model accounting for just random differences between participants in the slope of the frequency effect\nlmer(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + (Lg.UK.CDcount + 1|subjectID)...) gives us a random intercepts and slopes model accounting for both random differences between participants in the intercept and in the slope, as well as covariance in these differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTry out these variations and look carefully at the different results. Look, especially, at what happens to the Random effects part of the summary.\n\n\nThis will be an important and revealing exercise.\nWe can visualize the differences between the models in a plot showing the different predictions that the different models give us. Figure 6 shows what a mixed-effects model predicts are the effects of frequency on RT for different children in the CP study.\n\nThe predictions vary depending on the nature of the random effects we specify in the model.\n\n(Note that I figured out how to produce the plot from the information here.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Plot showing model predictions of the effect, for each individual, of word frequency on reading reaction time – predictions vary between models incorporating (a.) random effect of participants on intercepts only; (b.) random effect of participants on slopes only and (c.) random effect of participants on intercepts and on slopes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that:\n\nIf the model includes the random effect of participants on intercepts only then all the slopes are the same (the lines in the figure are parallel) because this model assumes that the only differences between participants are differences in the intercepts.\nIf the model includes the random effect of participants on slopes only then the slopes vary but they all have the same intercept. The plot does not show this but you can see how all the slopes are converging on one point somewhere on the left. This happens because this model assumes that the only differences between participants are differences in the slopes.\nIf the model includes the random effect of participants on intercepts and on slopes then we can see how the intercepts and the slopes vary. Given what we saw when we looked at the relation between frequency and RT for each participant considered separately we might argue that this model is much more realistic about the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is key to your skills development that you learn to make effective use of the warnings and error messages R can produce.\n\n\nYou do not have to just believe me when I say that || is in the model code to stop a problem appearing.\n\nExperiment – and see what happens when you change the code.

Do this and you will find useful help, as here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nExperimental psychologists will often collect data in studies where they present some stimuli to a sample of participants.\n\n\nClark (1973) showed that the appropriate analysis of experimental effects for such data requires the researcher to take into account the error variance due to unexplained or random differences between sampled participants and also to random differences between sampled stimuli. This is true in the context of psycholinguistics but it is also true in the context of work in any field where the presented stimuli can be understood to constitute a sample from a wider population of potential stimuli (e.g., stories about social situations, Judd et al., 2012).\nIf we were to estimate the average latency of the responses made by different children to each word, in the CP study data, we would see that there is considerable variation between words. We do this in Figure 7. (I work through the code for producing the plot in 02-mixed-workbook-answers.R.)\n\nSome words elicit slower and some elicit faster responses on average.\nWe can also see that there is, again, variation in the uncertainty of estimates, as reflected in differences in the lengths of the error bars corresponding to the standard errors of the estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Estimated intercepts (with SEs) calculated for each stimulus word, with coefficients ordered by average latency for each word\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, psychologists have been aware since Clark (1973) (if not earlier) that responses to experimental stimuli can vary because of random or unexplained differences between the stimuli: whether the stimuli are words, pictures or stories, etc. And researchers have been aware that if we did not take such variation into account, we might mistakenly detect an experimental effect, for example, as a significant difference between mean response in different conditions, simply because different stimuli presented in different conditions varied in some unknown way, randomly.\nFor many years, psychologists tried to take random differences between stimuli into account, alongside random differences between participants, using a variety of strategies with important limitations (see Baayen et al. (2008), for discussion). Clark (1973) suggested that researchers could calculate \\(minF'\\) (not F) when doing Analyses of Variance of experimental data\nThis involves a series of steps.\n\nYou start by aggregating your data\n\n\nBy-subjects data – for each subject, take the average of their responses to all the items\nBy-items data – for each item, take the average of all subjects’ responses to that item\n\n\nYou do separate ANOVAs, one for by-subjects (F1) data and one for by-items (F2) data\nYou put F1 and F2 together, calculating minF’\n\nAveraging data by-subjects or by-items is relatively simple. It is very common to see, in the literature, psychological reports in which F1 and F2 analysis results are presented (that is why I am explaining this).\nCalculating \\(minF'\\) is also relatively simple:\n\\[\nminF' = \\frac{MS_{effect}}{MS_{\\text{random-subject-effects}} + MS_{\\text{random-word-differences}}} = \\frac{F_1F_2}{F_1 + F_2}\n\\]\nHowever, after a while, psychologists stopped doing the extra step of the \\(minF'\\) calculation (Raaijmakers et al., 1999). They carried on calculating and reporting F1 and F2 ANOVA results but, as Baayen et al. (2008) discuss, that approach risks a high false positive error rate.\nPsychologists also found that while the \\(minF'\\) approach allowed them to take into account between-participant and between-stimulus differences it could not be applied where ANOVA could not be used. This stopped researchers from taking a comprehensive approach to error variance where they wanted to conduct multiple regression analyses.\nIn the psychological literature, you will often see multiple regression analyses of by-items data, where a sample of participants has been asked to respond to a sample of stimuli, and the analysis is of the effects of stimulus properties on outcomes averaged (over participants’ responses) to the mean outcome by item. The problem is that analyzing data only by-items ensures that we lose track of participant differences.\nLorch & Myers (1990) warn that analyzing only by-items mean RTs just assumes wrongly that subjects are a fixed effect. This approach, again, risks a higher rate of false positive errors.\n\n\nThe good thing is that, thanks to the advent of mixed-effects models, we now no longer need to tolerate these problems.\nIn the context of our working example, in our analysis of the CP study data, we can build up our mixed-effects model by adding a random effect to capture the impact of unexplained differences between stimuli.\nWe model the random effect of items on intercepts by modeling the intercept as two terms:\n\\[\n\\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_0 + W_{0j}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma_0\\) is the average intercept and \\(W_{0j}\\) represents the deviation, for each word, between the average intercept and the per-word intercept.\n\nOur model can now incorporate the additional random effect of items on intercepts:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1X_j + U_{0i}+ U_{1i}X_j + W_{0j} + e_{ij}\n\\]\nIn this model, the outcome \\(Y_{ij}\\) is related to:\n\nthe average intercept \\(\\gamma_0\\) and the word frequency effect \\(\\gamma_1X_j\\)\nplus random effects due to unexplained differences between participants in intercepts \\(U_{0i}\\) and the slope of the frequency effect \\(U_{1i}X_j\\)\nas well as random differences between items in intercepts \\(W_{0j}\\),\nin addition to the residual term \\(e_{ij}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhat about random effects associated with differences between stimulus items in the slopes of effects?\n\nJust as we may expect there to be between-participant differences in the slope of the word frequency effect, we may expect there to be between-stimulus differences in the slope of the effect of, e.g., participant age.\nRest assured, we will look at this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can fit a mixed-effects model of the \\(\\text{RT} \\sim \\text{frequency}\\) relationship, taking into account the random differences between participants and now also the random differences between stimulus words.\n\nlmer.all.2 &lt;- lmer(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + \n                         (Lg.UK.CDcount + 1||subjectID) +\n                         (1|item_name),\n             \n             data = long.all.noNAs)\n\nsummary(lmer.all.2)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: RT ~ Lg.UK.CDcount + ((1 | subjectID) + (0 + Lg.UK.CDcount |  \n    subjectID)) + (1 | item_name)\n   Data: long.all.noNAs\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 116976.7\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.1795 -0.5474 -0.1646  0.3058 12.9485 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups      Name          Variance Std.Dev.\n item_name   (Intercept)     3397    58.29  \n subjectID   Lg.UK.CDcount   3624    60.20  \n subjectID.1 (Intercept)   112314   335.13  \n Residual                   20704   143.89  \nNumber of obs: 9085, groups:  item_name, 159; subjectID, 61\n\nFixed effects:\n              Estimate Std.

You should notice three changes.\n\nYou can see that the estimate for the effect of word frequency on reading reaction time has changed again, it is now \\(\\beta = -72.33\\)\nitem_name   (Intercept)     3397 there is now an additional term in the list of random effects, giving the model estimate for variance associated with random differences between words in intercepts\nAnd you can see that the residual variance has changed. In the first model lmer.all.1 it was 23734, now it is 20704\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe reduction in residual variance is one way in which we can judge how good a job the model is doing in accounting for the variance in the outcome, observed response reaction time.\n\n\nWe can see that by adding a term to account for differences between items we can reduce the amount by which the model estimates deviate from observed outcomes. This difference in error variance is, essentially, one basis for estimating how well the model fits the data, and a basis for estimating the variance explained by a model in terms of the \\(R^2\\) statistic you have seen before.\nWe will come back to this.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I have said, we usually do not aim to examine the specific deviation from the average intercept or the average fixed effect slope for a participant or stimulus. We estimate just the spread of deviations by-participants or by-items.\nA mixed-effects model like our final model includes fixed effects corresponding to the intercept and the slope of the word frequency effect plus the variances:\n\n\\(var(U_{0i})\\) variance of deviations by-participants from the average intercept;\n\\(var(U_{1i}X_j)\\) variance of deviations by-participants from the average slope of the frequency effect;\n\\(var(W_{0j})\\) variance of deviations by-items from the average intercept;\n\\(var(e_{ij})\\) residuals, at the response level, after taking into account all other terms.\n\nBecause we have variances, we may expect the random effects of participants or items to covary, e.g., participants who are slow to respond may also be more susceptible to the frequency effect, as can be seen in Figure 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Scatterplot showing the relationship between estimated coefficients for the intercept and for the frequency effect, for each child analysed separately\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is why it would often make sense to specify, among the random effects of the model, terms corresponding to the covariance of the random effects:\n\n\\(covar(U_{0i}, U_{1i}X_j)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember we excluded random effects covariance using ||.\n\n\nIn Section 1.9.5.2, I noted how we used the || notation to stop the model estimating the covariance between differences between participants in intercepts and in slopes. The reason I did this is that if I had requested that the model estimate the covariance the model would have failed to converge. What this means depends on understanding how mixed-effects models are estimated. We shall have to return to a development of that understanding later. For now, it is enough to note that mixed-effects models fitted with lmer() often have more difficulty with random effects covariance estimates.\n\n\n\nThere is no official convention on what or how to report the results of a mixed-effects model. Lotte Meteyard and I suggest what psychologists should report in an article (Meteyard & Davies, 2020) that has been downloaded a few thousand times so, maybe, our advice will help to influence practice.\n\n\nExplain what you did, and why.\nExplain what you found, not just whether effects are significant or not.\n\n\n\nWe argue that researchers should explain what analysis they have done and, where space allows, should report both the estimates of the fixed effects and the estimates of the random effects.\nWe think you can report the model code (maybe in an appendix, maybe in a note under a tabled summary of results).\n\nA table summary presenting model results can look like this.\n\n\n\nCoefficients\nEstimate\nSE\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n971.1\n51.9\n18.7\n\n\n\nFrequency effect\n-72.3\n10.8\n-6.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroups\nName\nVariance\nSD\n\n\n\n\n\nitem\n(Intercept)\n3397\n58.3\n\n\n\nparticipant\n(Intercept)\n112314\n335.1\n\n\n\nparticipant\nFrequency\n3624\n60.2\n\n\n\nresidual\n\n20704\n143.9\n\n\n\n\nNote: lmer(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + (Lg.UK.CDcount + 1||subjectID) + (1|item_name)\nBarr et al. (2013) argued that choices about random effects structure affect the generalizability of the estimates of fixed effects. In particular, it seems sensible to examine the possibility that the slope of the effect of an explanatory variable may vary at random between participants or between stimuli. Correspondingly, researchers should report and explain their decisions about the inclusion of random effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nResearchers should report their modelling in sufficient detail that their results can be reproduced by others.\n\n\nIt is normal practice in psychology to report the p-values associated with null hypothesis significance tests of effects when reporting analysis. Performing hypothesis tests using t- or F-distributions depends on the calculation of degrees of freedom yet it is uncertain how degrees of freedom should be counted when analyzing multilevel data (Baayen et al. (2008)). In most software applications, however, p-values associated with fixed effects may be calculated using an approximation for denominator degrees of freedom.\nWe will come back to how we should report the results of mixed-effects models because, here, too, in learning about writing, we can benefit by developing our approach, in depth, step by step.\n\n\n\nA large proportion of psychological studies involves scenarios in which the researcher samples both participants and some kind of stimuli. Often, the researcher will present the stimuli to the participants for response in some version of a range of possible designs:\n\nall participants see and respond to all stimuli;\nparticipants respond to different sub-sets of stimuli in different conditions (or in different groups) but they see and respond to all stimuli in a sub-set;\nparticipants are allocated to respond to stimulus sub-sets according to a counter balancing scheme (e.g., through the use of Latin squares).\n\nWhatever version of this scenario, if participants are responding to multiple stimuli and if multiple partcipants respond to each stimulus, then the data will have a multilevel structure such that each observation can be grouped both by participant and by stimulus.\nWe are interested in taking into account the random effects associated with unexplained or random differences between participants or between stimuli. We often discuss the accounting of these effects in terms of the estimation of error variances associated with the random differences, calling the effects of the differences random effects. Where we have to deal with both samples of participants and samples of stimuli, we can talk about crossed random effects.\nThe terms are not that important. The insight is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn general, in experimental psychological science, when we do data analysis, if we want to estimate effects of experimental variables more accurately then our models need to incorporate terms to capture the impact on observed outcomes of sampled participants and sampled stimuli.\n\n\nHistorically, we have, as a field, learned to take into account these sampling effects. Now, and most likely, more and more commonly in the future, we are learning to use multilevel or mixed-effects models to do this.\n\n\n\n\nWe discussed the way that data are structured when they come from studies with repeated measures designs. Critically, we examined data from a common study design where a sample of stimulus items are presented for response to members of a participant sample. This means that each observation can be grouped by participant and, also, by stimulus. The possibility that observations can be grouped means that the data have a multilevel structure.\nThe multilevel structure requires the use of linear mixed-effects models when we seek to estimate the effects of experimental variables. The fact that data can be grouped both by participant and by stimulus means that the model can incorporate random effects to capture random between-participant differences as well as between-stimulus differences.\nThe use of mixed-effects models has meant that psychologists no longer need to adopt compromise solutions which have important limitations, like by-items and by-subjects analyses.\n\n\n\nWe reviewed the ways that experimental data can be untidy. And we outlined the steps that may be required to process untidy data into a tidy format suitable for analysis. As is typical for the data analysis we need to do for experimental psychological science, getting data ready for analysis requires a series of steps including: access; import; restructure; select variables; and filter observations.\nWe then developed a mixed-effects model to answer the question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: What word properties influence responses to words in a test of reading aloud?\n\n\n\nOur analysis focused on the relationship between reading response reaction time (RT, in ms) and the predictor word frequency. We examined how the effect of word frequency was estimated in a linear model ignoring the multilevel structure and then in mixed-effects models which incorporated terms to capture:\n\nvariance associated with random differences between participants in intercepts or in the slope of the frequency effect,\nvariance associated with random differences between items in intercepts.\n\nWe saw that estimates of the frequency effect differed between different models.\n\n\n\n\nWe used a number of functions to tidy and visualize the CP study data.\n\nread_csv() and read_csv() to load source data files into the R workspace\npivot_longer() to restructure data from wide to long\nfull_join() to put together data from separate data-sets; in our example, from data-sets holding information about participant attributes, stimulus word properties, and participant behaviours\nselect() to select the variables we need\nfilter() to filter observations based on conditions\nna.omit() to remove missing values\nFor visualisation, we used facet_wrap() to show plots of the relationship between outcome and predictor variables separately for different groups (by participant, or by item)\n\nFor our analyses:\n\nWe used lmer() to fit a multilevel model.\n\nWe used the summary() function to get model results for both linear models and for the mulilevel or liner mixed-effects model.\n\n\n\n\n(Baayen et al., 2008; see also Barr et al., 2013; Judd et al., 2012) discuss mixed-effects models with crossed random effects in a variety of contexts in psychological science. The explanations are clear and the examples are often helpful.\nI wrote a tutorial article on mixed-effects models with Lotte Meteyard (Meteyard & Davies, 2020). We discuss how important the approach now is for psychological science, what researchers worry about when they use it, and what they should do and report when they use the method.\n\n\n\n\nBaayen, R.

    "text": "In the conceptual introduction to multilevel data and the workbook introduction to multilevel data chapters, we looked at a multilevel structured data-set in which there were observations about children’s grades, and it became evident that those children can be grouped by or under classes. As we discussed, this kind of data structure will come from studies with a very common design in which, for example, the researcher records observations about a sample of children who are members of a sample of classes. In working with these kind of data, it is common to say that the observations of children’s grades are nested within classes in a hierarchy.\nMany Psychologists conduct studies where observations are properly understood to be structured in groups of some form but where, nevertheless, it is inappropriate to think of the observations as being nested (Baayen et al., 2008). We are talking, here, about repeated-measures designs where the experimenter presents a sample of multiple stimuli for response to each participant in a sample of multiple participants. This is another very common experimental design in psychological science.\nStudies with repeated-measures designs will produce data with a structure that, also, requires the use of mixed-effects models but, as we shall see, the way we think about the structure will be a bit more complicated. We could say that observations of the responses made by participants to each stimulus can be grouped by participant: each person will tend to respond in similar ways to different stimuli. Or, we could say that observations of responses can be grouped by stimulus because each stimulus will tend to evoke similar kinds of responses in different people. Or, we could say that both forms of grouping should be taken into account at the same time.\nWe shall take the third position and this chapter will concern why, and how we will adapt our thinking and practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick start: Workbook introduction to mixed-effects models\n\n\n\nThis chapter presents ideas and methods relating to the analysis of repeated-measures data using mixed-effects models in which we extend the ideas and the methods in depth.\n\nYou can find a quick start, focused on practical analysis steps, in the workbook introduction to mixed-effects models.",

Each time a word was shown, each child had to read the word out loud and their response was recorded. Thus, the CP reading study data-set comprised observations about the responses made by 62 children to 160 words.\nIn addition to the reading task, CP administered tests of reading skill (TOWRE sight word and phonemic tests, Torgesen et al., 1999), reading experience (CART, Stainthorp, 1997), the Spoonerisms sub-test of the Phonological Awareness test Battery (PhAB, Frederickson et al., 1997), and an orthographic choice test measure of orthographic knowledge. She also recorded the gender and the handedness of the children.\nWe are going to use the CP study data to examine the answers to a research question similar to the question CP investigated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: What word properties influence responses to words in a test of reading aloud?\n\n\n\nWe can look at the answers to this question while also taking into account the impacts of random differences – between sampled participants or between sampled words – using mixed-effects models.\nUltimately, the CP data-set were incorporated in an analysis of the impact of age on reading skills over the life-span, reported by Davies et al. (2017). You can find more details on the data and the methods in that paper. (Data and analysis code are shared through the journal article webpage [paywalled] here, and a preprint version of the article can be accessed here.)\nThe CP study resembles many studies in psychological science. The critical features of the study are that:\n\nWe have an outcome measure – the reading response – observed multiple times.\n\n\nWe have multiple responses recorded for each participant: they make one response to each stimulus (here, each stimulus word), for the multiple stimuli that they see in the experimental reading task.\nAnd we have multiple responses recorded for each stimulus: one response is made to each stimulus by each participant, for all the participants who completed the task, in a sample of multiple participants.\n\nThe presence of these features is the reason why we need to use mixed-effects models in our analysis. These features are common across a range of study designs so the lessons we learn will apply frequently in psychological research. This is the reason why it is important we teach and learn how to use mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the data: get the data file and the .R script you can use to do the exercises that will support your learning.\n\nYou can download the files folder for this chapter by clicking on the link 02-mixed.zip.\n\n\n\nThe practical materials folder includes data files and an .R script:\n\nCP study word naming rt 180211.dat\nCP study word naming acc 180211.dat\nwords.items.5 120714 150916.csv\nall.subjects 110614-050316-290518.csv\nlong.all.noNAs.csv\n402-02-mixed-workbook.R the workbook you will need to do the practical exercises.\n\nThe .dat files are tab delimited files holding behavioural data: the latency or reaction time rt (in milliseconds) and the accuracy acc of response made by each participant to each stimulus.\nThe .csv files are comma separated values files. The words.items file holds information about the 160 stimulus words presented in the experimental reading (word naming) task. The all.subjects file holds information about the 62 participants who volunteered to take part in the experiment.\nSo: we will be working with multiple data files located in a .zip folder called 02-mixed. And, in this folder, we have got four files that we will need to import or read in to R.\nIn the following, I will describe a series of steps through which we get the data ready for analysis. However, as we shall see, you can avoid these steps by using the pre-tidied data-set:\n\nlong.all.noNAs.csv\n\nThe data files are collected together with the .R script:\n\n402-02-mixed-workbook.R.\n\nDuring practical sessions, each week, you can use the workbook to prompt your code construction and your thinking, with support.\n\n\nAfter practical sessions, you will be able to download an answers version of the workbook .R so check back here after the session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the answers: get the data file and the .R script with answers.\n\nYou can download the files folder for this chapter by clicking on the link 02-mixed-answers.zip.\n\n\n\nThe link to this folder will not work until after a session has finished.\nWhen the link is live, you will be able to download a folder including:\n\n402-02-mixed-workbook-with-answers.R with answers to questions and example code for doing the exercises.\n\nBefore we do anything else, we need to talk about the messiness of real Psychological data and how we deal with it.",

    "text": "Ordinarily, textbooks and guides to data analysis give you the data ready for analysis but this situation will never be true for your professional practice (at least, not at first). Instead of pretending that data arrive ready for analysis, we are going to look at the process of data tidying, step-by-step. This will help you to get ready for the same process when you have to develop and use it in your own research.\nWe are going to spend a bit of time looking at the data tidying process. This process involves identifying and resolving a series of challenges, in order. Looking at the tidying process will give you a concrete sense of the structure in the data. You should also take this opportunity to reflect on the nature of the process itself – what we have to do and why, in what order and why – so that you can develop a sense of the process you might need to build when the time comes for you to prepare your own data for analysis.\nThe time that we spend looking at data tidying is an investment in learning that will save you time later, in your professional work. If, however, you want to skip it, go to section Section 1.8.\n\n\nIn analyzing psychological data, the first step is usually to collect the data together. In psychological research, the data may exist, at first, in separate files. For the CP study, we have separate files for each of the pieces of information we need to use in our analyses:\n\nParticipant attributes: information about participants’ age, gender, identifier code, and abilities on various measures.\nStimulus attributes: information about stimulus items, e.g., the word, its item number, its value on each variable in a set of psycholinguistic properties (like word length, frequency).\nBehaviour: behavioural observations e.g. reaction time or accuracy of responses made by each participant to each stimulus word.\n\nOften, we need all these kinds of information for our analyses but different pieces of information are produced in separate ways and come to us in separate files. For example, we may collect experimental response data using software like PsychoPy, E-Prime, Qualtrics or DMDX. We may collect information about participant characteristics using standardized measures, or by asking participants to complete a set of questions on their age, gender, and so on.\n\n\n\nOften, the files we get are untidy: not in a useful or tidy format. For example, if you open the file CP_study_word_naming_rt_180211.dat (a .dat or tab delimited file) in Excel, you will see a spreadsheet that looks like Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: CP study RTs .dat file\n\n\n\nTypical of the output from data collection software, we can see a data table with:\n\nin the top row, column header labels item_name, AislingoC, AllanaD ...;\nin the first (leftmost) column, row labels item_name, act, ask, both ...;\nfor each row, we see values equal to the reaction time (RT) observed for the response made to each stimulus (listed in the row labels);\nfor each column, we see values equal to the RTs observed for each person (listed in the column labels);\nand at each intersection of row and column (for each cell), we see the RT observed for a response made by a participant to a stimulus.\n\nData laid out like this are sometimes said to be in wide format. You can see that the data are wide because at least one variable – here, reading reaction time – is held not in one column but spread out over several columns, side-by-side. Thus, the data-set is wide with fewer rows and many columns.\nWe want the data in what is called the tidy format.\n\n\nThere are three inter-related rules which make data tidy (Grolemund & Wickham, n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn tidy data:\n\nEach variable must have its own column.\nEach observation must have its own row.\nEach value must have its own cell.\n\n\n\nYou can read more about tidy data here.\nFor our purposes, the reason we want the data in tidy format is that it is required for the functions we are going to use for mixed-effects modelling. However, in general, tidy format is maximally flexible, and convenient, for use with different R functions.",

    "text": "To answer our research question, we will need to combine the behavioural data with information about the participants (age, gender …) and about the words (word, frequency …) We will need to ensure that the data-set we construct will be in tidy format. We will need to select variables (columns) to get just those required for our later analyses. And we will need to filter cases (rows), excluding errors or outliers.\nWe shall need to do this work in a series of processing steps:\n\nImport the data or read the data into R, see Section 1.7.1\nRestructure the data, see Section 1.7.3\nSelect or transform variables, see Section 1.7.6\nFilter observations, see Section 1.7.7\n\nWe will use {tidyverse} library functions from the beginning, starting with the import stage.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n(Every step can also be done in alternative processing steps with the same result using base R code.)\n\n\nI am going to assume you have downloaded the data files, that they are all in the same folder, and that you know where they are on your computer or server. We need to use different versions of the read_ function to read all four files into R.\n\nbehaviour.rt &lt;- read_tsv(\"CP study word naming rt 180211.dat\", na = \"-999\")\nbehaviour.acc &lt;- read_tsv(\"CP study word naming acc 180211.dat\", na = \"-999\")\nsubjects &lt;- read_csv(\"all.subjects 110614-050316-290518.csv\", na = \"-999\")\nwords &lt;- read_csv(\"words.items.5 120714 150916.csv\", na = \"-999\")\n\nThese different versions respect the different ways in which the .dat and .csv file formats work. We need read_tsv() when data files consist of tab separated values. We need read_csv() when data files consist of comma separated values.\nYou can read more about the {tidyverse} {readr} library of helpful functions here\nIt is very common to get experimental data in all sorts of different formats. Learning to use tidyverse functions will make it easier to cope with this when you do research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe use the read_ function to read in the data\n\nentering (here, at least) arguments – inside the brackets after the function name – to tell R what file we need and how missing values (NAs) are coded.\n\n\n\nIt will help your understanding to examine an example. Take a look at what this line of code includes, element by element.\n\nbehaviour.rt &lt;- read_tsv(\"CP study word naming rt 180211.dat\", na = \"-999\")\n\n\nWe write behaviour.rt &lt;- read_tsv(...) to create an object in the R environment, which we call behaviour.rt: the object with this name is the data-set we read into R using read_tsv(...).\nWhen we write the function read_tsv(...) we include two arguments inside it.\nread_tsv(\"CP study word naming rt 180211.dat\", ... first, the name of the file, given in quotes \"\" and then a comma.\nread_tsv(..., na = \"-999\") second, we tell R that there are some missing values na which are coded with the value \"-999\".\n\n\n\n\nIn the data-sets – typically, the spreadsheets – we create in our research, we will have values missing for different reasons. Take another look at the data spreadsheet you saw earlier, Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn R, a missing value is said to be “not available”: NA.\n\n\nYou should be able to see that the spreadsheet holds information, as explained, about the RTs of the responses made by each child to each stimulus word. Each of the cells in the spreadsheet (i.e. the box where a column intersects with a row) includes a number value. Most of the values are positive numbers like 751.3: the reaction time of a response, recorded in milliseconds. The values have to be positive because they represent the length of time between the moment the stimulus word is presented on the test computer screen and the moment the child’s spoken word response has begun to be registered by the computer microphone and sound recording software.\nSome of the cells hold the value -999, however. Obviously, we cannot have negative RT. The value represents the fact that we have no data. Take a look at Figure 1: we have a -999 where we should have a RT for the response made by participant AllanaD to the word broad. This -999 is there because, for some reason, we did not record an RT or a response for that combination of participant and stimulus.\nWe can choose any value we like, as researchers, to code for missing data like this. Some researchers choose not to code for the absence of a response recording or leave the cell in a spreadsheet blank or empty where data are missing. This is bad practice though it is common.\nThere are a number of reasons why it is bad practice to just leave a cell empty when it is empty because no observation is to be recorded.\n\nData may be missing for different reasons: maybe a child did not make any response to a stimulus (often called a “null response”); or maybe a child made a response but there was a microphone or other technical fault; or maybe a child made a response but it was an error and (here) the corresponding performance measure (RT) cannot be counted.\nIf you do not code for missingness in the data then the software you use will do it for you, but you may not know how it does so, or where.\nIf you have missing data, you ought to be able to identify where the data are missing.\n\nI use -999 to code for missing values because you should never see a value like that in real reading RT data. You can use whatever value you like but you should make sure you do code for missing data somehow.\n\n\n\nWe are going to need to restructure these data from a wide format to a longer format. We need to restructure both behavioural data-sets, accuracy and RT. We do this using the pivot_longer() function.\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n             pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\nacc.long &lt;- behaviour.acc %&gt;%\n              pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"accuracy\")\n\nResearchers used to have to do this sort of thing by hand, using copying and pasting, in Excel or SPSS. Doing the process by hand takes many hours or days. And you always make errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDoing data-set construction programmatically, using R functions, is generally faster and more reliable than doing it by hand.\n\n\nHere, we use a function you may have seen before: pivot_longer(). It will help your understanding to examine the code carefully.\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n             pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\nThe name of the function comes from the fact that we are starting with data in wide format e.g. behaviour.rt where we have what should be a single variable of observations (RTs) arranged in a wide series of multiple columns, side-by-side (one column for each participant). But we want to take those wide data and lengthen the data-set, increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.\nLet’s look at this line of code bit by bit. It includes a powerful function that accomplishes a lot of tasks, so it is worth explaining this function in some detail.\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n\n\nAt the start, I tell R that I am going to create a new longer data-set (more rows, fewer columns) that I shall call rt.long.\nI will create this longer data-set from &lt;- the original wide data-set behaviour.rt.\nand I will create the new longer data-set by taking the original wide data-set and piping it %&gt;% to the pivot function coded on the next line:\n\n\npivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\n\nOn this next line, I tell R how to do the pivoting by using three arguments.\n\n\npivot_longer(2:62...)\n\n\nFirst, I tell R that I want to re-arrange all the columns that can be found in the data-set from the second column to the sixty-second column.\nIn a spreadsheet, we have a number of columns.\nColumns can be identified by their position in the spreadsheet.\nThe position of a column in a spreadsheet can be identified by number, from the leftmost column (column number 1) to the rightmost column (here, column number 62) in our data-set.\nSo this argument tells R exactly which columns I want to pivot.\n\n\npivot_longer(..., names_to = \"subjectID\", ...)\n\n\nSecond, I tell R that I want it to take the column labels and put them into a new column, called subjectID.\nIn the wide data-set behaviour.rt, each column holds a list of numbers (RTs) but begins with a word in the topmost cell, the name code for a participant, in the column label position.\nWe want to keep the information about which participant produces which response when we pivot the wide data to a longer structure.\nWe do this by asking R to take the column labels (the participant names) and listing them in a new column, called subjectID which now holds the names as participant ID codes.\n\n\npivot_longer(...values_to = \"RT\")\n\n\nThird, we tell R that all the RT values should be put in a single column.\nWe can understand that this new column RT will hold RT observations in a vertical stack, one cell for each response by a person to a word, with rows ordered by subjectID.\n\nThere are 61 columns of data listed by participant though 62 children were tested because we lost one child’s data through an administrative error. As a result, in the wide data sets there are 62 columns, with the first column holding item_name data.\nYou can find more information about pivoting data here\nAnd you can find more information specifically about the pivot_longer() operation here\n\n\n\nAs I noted, one problem with the wide format is that the data are structured so that the column names are not names of variables. In our example wide format data-set, behaviour.rt, the columns are headed by a participant identity code or name but a participant code is not the name of a variable, it is a value of the variable I call subjectID.\nIn the design of the CP reading study, we want to take into account the impact of differences between participants on response RT (so, we need to identify which participant makes which response). But we do not see the responses made by a participant as a predictor variable.\nA second problem is that, in a wide format file like behaviour.rt, information about the responses made to each stimulus word is all on the same row (that seems good) but in different columns. Each person responded to all the words. But the response made to a word e.g. act made by one participant is in a different column (e.g., 594.8ms, for AislingoC) from the response made to the same word by a different participant (e.g., 586ms, for AlexB). This means that information about the responses made to each stimulus word are spread out as values across multiple columns.\nYou can see this for yourself if you inspect the source rt data using head() to view the top four rows of the data-set.\n\n\n\n\n\nitem_name\nAislingoC\nAlexB\nAllanaD\nAmyR\nAndyD\nAnnaF\nAoifeH\nChloeBergin\nChloeF\nChloeS\nCianR\nConorF\nDavidL\nDillonF\nDJHerlihy\nEamonD\nEimearK\nEllenH\nEoinL\nGrainneH\nJackBr\nJackK\nJackS\nJamesoC\nJenniferoS\nKateF\nKayleighMc\nKenW\nKevinL\nKieranF\nKillianB\nKirstyC\nLeeJ\nMarkC\nMatthewC\nMeganoB\nMichaelaoD\nNataliaR\nNiallG\nNiallGavin\nNiallW\nOisinN\nOlaA\nOwenD\nPalomaM\nPauricT\nPerryD\nRachelD\nRebeccaGr\nRebeccaM\nRebeccaR\nRoisinF\nRonanT\nSarahP\nShaunaBr\nSiobhanR\nTaraB\nTeeTeeOj\nThomasK\nTristianT\nZainab\n\n\n\n\nact\n594.8\n586.0\nNA\n693.0\n597\n627.0\n649.0\n1081.0\n642.0\n622.7\n701.0\n686.0\n951.0\n661.0\n692.0\n670.0\n502.4\n578.4\n651.8\n441.6\n895.2\n529.0\n639.0\n809\n676.9\n568.8\n586.1\n591.3\n587\n586\n723.9\n1428.0\n557.0\n639.4\n676\n714.8\n623.3\n615.0\n796.0\n568.4\n800.9\n595\nNA\n574.9\n628\n797.0\n652\n757.0\n631.0\n520.5\n640.0\n733.0\n566\n758.0\n670.0\n532.4\n615.7\n540.0\n1390.0\n747\n651.0\n\n\nask\n481.5\n864.0\n1163.0\n694.4\n616\n631.0\n538.0\n799.3\n603.0\n526.0\n591.5\n699.6\n827.2\n635.0\n654.0\n508.0\n564.0\n822.0\n479.7\n600.0\n617.6\n555.9\n654.6\n765\n856.0\n576.7\n690.3\n501.9\n634\n626\n523.3\n640.7\n516.0\n625.7\n561\n698.2\n685.0\n606.0\n793.0\n551.9\n668.7\n722\n868.0\n633.0\n578\n660.2\n851\n640.3\n630.0\n535.0\n568.0\n579.7\n562\n747.0\n602.4\n558.4\n691.0\n580.8\n590.9\n795\n740.5\n\n\nboth\n457.5\n670.0\n1114.3\n980.0\n1019\n796.1\n545.2\nNA\n581.0\n568.4\n665.0\n751.0\n917.0\n808.1\n737.6\n597.0\n475.0\n608.0\n699.2\n600.6\n527.3\n601.0\n982.1\n917\n854.4\n571.6\n825.3\n584.0\n720\n571\n624.0\n853.4\nNA\n703.0\n781\n1065.8\n591.5\n559.2\n837.6\n612.0\n743.4\n743\n919.0\n883.0\n616\n734.6\n658\n574.4\n634.9\n559.7\n689.0\n997.8\n648\n753.4\n548.0\n530.5\n625.4\n552.0\n985.0\n640\n764.0\n\n\nbox\n546.0\n748.6\n975.0\n678.0\n589\n604.0\n574.0\n658.0\n688.7\n492.0\n641.0\n699.0\n824.0\n731.6\n634.0\n557.5\n520.1\n581.0\n1191.0\n612.0\n540.0\n540.0\n810.0\n885\n573.8\n614.9\n722.0\n594.6\n632\n549\n564.0\n632.6\n668.6\n627.0\n577\n785.9\n649.0\n616.0\n928.0\n608.7\n690.0\n857\n886.6\n544.0\n863\n726.0\n812\n640.5\n613.8\n395.1\n656.7\n604.7\n530\n667.4\n547.7\n570.0\n585.6\n532.0\n634.0\n764\n912.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis structure is a problem for visualization and for analysis because the functions we will use require us to specify single columns for an outcome variable like reaction time.\nWe are looking at the process of tidying data because untidiness is very common. Learning how to deal with it will save you a lot of time and grief later.\nYou should check for yourself how subjectID and RT or accuracy scores get transposed from the old wide structure to the new long structure.\n\n# RT data\nhead(behaviour.rt)\nhead(rt.long)\n\n# accuracy data\nhead(behaviour.acc)\nhead(acc.long)\n\nIf you compare the rt.long or acc.long data with the data in the original wide format then you can see how – in going from wide – we have re-arranged the data to a longer and narrower set of columns:\n\none column listing each word;\none column for subjectID;\nand one column for RT or accuracy.\n\nWhat a check will show you is that we have multiple rows for responses to each item so that the item is repeated multiple times in different rows.\nThese data are now tidy.\n\nEach column has information about one variable\nAnd each row has information about one observation, here, the response made by a participant to a word\n\nThis is a big part of data tidying now done. However, these data are incomplete. Next we shall combine behavioural observations with data about stimulus words and about participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer our research question, we next need to combine the RT with the accuracy data, and then the combined behavioural data with participant information and stimulus information. This is because, as we have seen, information about behavioural responses, about participant attributes or stimulus word properties, are located in separate files.\nMany researchers have completed this kind of operation by hand. This involves copying and pasting bits of data in a spreadsheet. It can take hours or days. I know because I have done it, and I have seen others do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nPlease do not try to combine data-sets through manual operations e.g. in Excel. I guarantee that:\n\nYou will make mistakes.\nYou will not know when or where those mistakes are in your data.\n\nThere are better ways to spend your time.\n\n\nWe can combine the data-sets, in the way that we need, using the {tidyverse} full_join() function. This gets the job done quickly, and accurately.\nFirst, we join RT and accuracy data together.\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;% \n          full_join(acc.long)\n\nThen, we join subject and item information to the behavioural data.\n\nlong.subjects &lt;- long %&gt;% \n                   full_join(subjects, by = \"subjectID\")\n\nlong.all &lt;- long.subjects %&gt;%\n              full_join(words, by = \"item_name\")\n\nNotice, we can let R figure out how to join the pieces of data together. If we were doing this by hand then we would need to check very carefully the correspondences between observations in different data-sets.\nHere, in a series of steps, we take one data-set and join it (merge it) with the second data-set. Let’s look at an example element by element to better understand how this is accomplished.\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;% \n           full_join(acc.long)\n\nThe code work as follows.\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;%\n\n\nWe create a new data-set we call long.\nWe do this by taking one original data-set rt.long and %&gt;% piping it to the operation defined in the second step.\n\n\nfull_join(acc.long)\n\n\nIn this second step, we use the function full_join() to add observations from a second original data-set acc.long to those already from rt.long\n\nThe addition of observations from one database joining to those from another happens through a matching process.\n\nR looks at the data-sets being merged.\nIt identifies if the two data-sets have columns in common. Here, the data-sets have subjectID and item_name in common).\nR can use these common columns to identify rows of data. Here, each row of data will be identified by both subjectID and item_name i.e. as data about the response made by a participant to a word.\nR will then do a series of identity checks, comparing one data-set with the other and, row by row, looking for matching values in the columns that are common to both data-sets.\nIf there is a match then R joins the corresponding rows of data together.\nIf there isn’t a match then it creates NAs where there are missing entries in one row for one data-set which cannot be matched to a row from the joining data-set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that in one example, the example of code I discuss here, I did not specify identifying columns in common, allowing the function to do the work. In the other code chunks I did: long.all &lt;- long.subjects %&gt;% full_join(words, by = \"item_name\") using the by = ... argument.\n\nSometimes, you can vary in how you employ a _join() function.\nIt may help to specify the identifying column if you want to make explicit (to yourselves and others) how the process is to be completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the {tidyverse} family of dplyr functions, when you work with multiple data-sets (tables of data), we call the data-sets relational data.\nThere are three families of functions (like verbs) designed to work with relational data:\n\nMutating joins, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.\nFiltering joins, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.\nSet operations, which treat observations as if they were set elements.\n\nWe can connect data-sets – relate them – according to shared variables like subjectID, item_name (for our data). In {tidyverse}, the variables that connect pairs of tables are called keys where, and this is what counts, key(-s) are variable(-s) that uniquely identify an observation.\nFor the experimental reading data, we have observations about each response made by a participant (one of 61 subjects) to an item (one of 160 words). For these data, we can match up a pair of RT and accuracy observations for each (unique) subjectID-item_name combination. If you reflect, we could not combine the RT and accuracy data correctly if we did not have both identifying variables in both data-sets, because both column variables are required to uniquely identify each observation.\nFurther, we could not combine the RT and accuracy data correctly if there were mismatches in values of the identifying variable. Sometimes, I have done this operation and it has gone wrong because a subjectID has been spelled one way in one data-set e.g. hugh and another way in the other data-set e.g. HughH. This leads me to share some advice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nBe careful about spelling identifiers.\nAlways check your work after merger operations.\n\nYou can check your work by calculating data-set lengths to ensure the number of rows in the new data-set matches your expectations, given the study design and data collection procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used the full_join() function.\nThere are three kinds of joins.\n\nA left join keeps all observations in x.\nA right join keeps all observations in y.\nA full join keeps all observations in x and y.\n\nI used full_join() because I wanted to retain all observations from both data-sets, whether there was a match (as assumed) or not, in the identifying variables, between observations in each data-set.\n\n\n\n\nBreak the join: You can examine how the full_join() works by experimenting with stopping it from working.\n\nAs I discuss, you need to have matches in values on key (common) variables. If the subjectID is different on different data-sets, you will lose data that would otherwise be merged to form the merged or composite data-set.\nCheck what happens if you deliberately misspell one of the subjectID values in one of the original source wide behavioural data files.\nTo be safe, you might want to do this exercise with copies of the source files kept in a folder you create for this purpose. If it goes wrong, you can always re-access the source files and read them in again.\nYou can check what happens before and after you break the match by counting the number of rows in the data-set that results from the merger. We can count the number of rows in a data-set with:\n\nlength(long.all$RT)\n\n[1] 9762\n\n\nThis bit of code takes the length of the vector (i.e. variable column RT in data-set long.all), thus counting the number of rows in the data-set.\n\n\n\n\nOK, now we have all the data about everything all in one big, long and wide, data-set. But we do not actually require all of the data-set for the analyses we are going to do.\nWe next need to do two things. First, we need to get rid of variables we will not use: we do that by using select(). Then, we need to remove errors and outlying short RT observations: we do that by using filter() in Section Section 1.7.7.\nWe are going to select just the variables we need using the select() function.\n\nlong.all.select &lt;- long.all %&gt;% \n                        select(item_name, subjectID, RT, accuracy, \n                               Lg.UK.CDcount, brookesIMG, AoA_Kup_lem, \n                               Ortho_N, regularity, Length, BG_Mean, \n                               Voice,   Nasal,  Fricative,  Liquid_SV,\n                               Bilabials,   Labiodentals,   Alveolars,\n                               Palatals,    Velars, Glottals, \n                               age.months, TOWREW_skill, TOWRENW_skill, \n                               spoonerisms, CART_score)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNotice that these variables do not have reader-friendly names: but naming things is important.\n\nCheck out the ever-useful Jenny Bryan’s advice.\n\n\n\nThe names we have in the CP study data were fine for internal use within my research group but we should be careful to ensure that variables have names that make sense to others and to our future selves. We can adjust variable names using the rename() function but I will leave that as an exercise for you to do.\n\n\n\nSelect different variables: You could analyze the CP study data for a research report.\n\nWhat if you wanted to analyze a different set of variables, could you select different variables?\n\n\n\n\nWe now have a tidy data-set long.all.select with 26 columns and 9762 rows.\nThe data-set includes missing values, designated NA. Here, every error (coded 0, in accuracy) corresponds to an NA in the RT column.\nThe data-set also includes outlier data. In this context, \\(RT &lt; 200\\) are probably response errors or equipment failures. We will want to analyse accuracy later, so we shall need to be careful about getting rid of NAs.\nAt this point, I am going to exclude two sets of observations only.\n\nobservations corresponding to correct response reaction times that are too short: \\(RT &lt; 200\\).\nplus observations corresponding to the word false which (because of stupid Excel auto-formatting) dropped item attribute data.\n\nWe can do this using the filter() function, setting conditions on rows, as arguments.\n\n# step 1\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select %&gt;% \n                            filter(item_name != 'FALSE')\n\n# step 2\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select.filter %&gt;%\n                            filter(RT &gt;= 200)\n\nHere, I am using the function filter() to …\n\nCreate a new data-set long.all.select.filter &lt;- ... by\nUsing functions to work on the data named immediately to the right of the assignment arrow: long.all.select\nAn observation is included in the new data-set if it matches the condition specified as an argument in the filter() function call, thus:\n\n\nfilter(item_name !='FALSE') means: include in the new data-set long.all.select.filter all observations from the old data-set long.all.select that are not != (! not = equal to) the value FALSE in the variable item_name,\nthen recreate the long.all.select.filter as a version of itself (with no name change) by including in the new version only those observations where RT was greater than or equal to 200ms using RT &gt;= 200.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe difference between = and ==\nYou need to be careful to distinguish these signs.\n\n= assigns a value, so x = 2 means “x equals 2”\n== tests a match so x == 2 means: “is x equal to 2?”\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can supply multiple arguments to filter() and this may be helpful if (1.) you want to filter observations according to a match on condition-A and condition-B (logical “and” is coded with &) or (2.) you want to filter observations according to a match on condition-A or condition-B (logical “or” is coded |).\nYou can read more about using multiple arguments to filter observations here.\n\n\n\n\nVary the filter conditions: in different ways\n\n\nChange the threshold for including RTs from RT &gt;= 200 to something else\nCan you assess what impact the change has? Note that you can count the number of observations (rows) in a data-set using e.g. length(data.set.name$variable.name)\n\nFiltering or re-coding observations is an important element of the research workflow in psychological science, as I examine in the discussion of data multiverse analyses here. How we do or do not remove observations from original data may have an impact on our results (as explored by, e.g., Steegen et al., 2014). It is important, therefore, that we learn how to do this reproducibly using R scripts that we can share with our research reports.\nYou can read further information about filtering here.\n\n\n\n\nWe will be working with the long.all.select.filter.csv data-set collated from the experimental, subject ability scores, and item property data collected for the CP word naming study.\nFor convenience, I am going to remove missing values before we go any further, using the na.omit() function.\n\nlong.all.noNAs &lt;- na.omit(long.all.select.filter)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe na.omit() function is powerful.\n\nIn using this function, I am asking R to create a new data-set long.all.noNAs from the old data-set long.all.select.filter in a process in which the new data-set will have no rows in which there is a missing value NA in any column.\nYou need to be reasonably sure, when you use this function, where your NAs may be because, otherwise, you may end the process with a new filtered data-set that has many fewer rows in it than you expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhead(long.all.noNAs, n = 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 26\n   item_name subjectID      RT accuracy Lg.UK.CDcount brookesIMG AoA_Kup_lem\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 act       AislingoC    595.        1          4.03          4        6.42\n 2 act       AlexB        586         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 3 act       AmyR         693         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 4 act       AndyD        597         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 5 act       AnnaF        627         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 6 act       AoifeH       649         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 7 act       ChloeBergin 1081         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 8 act       ChloeF       642         1          4.03          4        6.42\n 9 act       ChloeS       623.        1          4.03          4        6.42\n10 act       CianR        701         1          4.03          4        6.42\n# ℹ 19 more variables: Ortho_N &lt;dbl&gt;, regularity &lt;dbl&gt;, Length &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   BG_Mean &lt;dbl&gt;, Voice &lt;dbl&gt;, Nasal &lt;dbl&gt;, Fricative &lt;dbl&gt;, Liquid_SV &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Bilabials &lt;dbl&gt;, Labiodentals &lt;dbl&gt;, Alveolars &lt;dbl&gt;, Palatals &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Velars &lt;dbl&gt;, Glottals &lt;dbl&gt;, age.months &lt;dbl&gt;, TOWREW_skill &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   TOWRENW_skill &lt;dbl&gt;, spoonerisms &lt;dbl&gt;, CART_score &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nIf we inspect long.all.noNAs, we can see that we have now got a tidy data-set with all the data we need for our analyses:\n\nOne observation per row, corresponding to data about a response made by a participant to a stimulus in an experimental trial\nOne variable per column\nWe have information about the speed and accuracy of responses\nAnd we have information about the children and about the words.\n\nWe have removed the missing values and we have filtered outliers.\n\n\n\nHaving produced the tidy data-set, we may wish to share it, or save ourselves the trouble of going through the process again. We can do this by creating a .csv file.\n\nwrite_csv(long.all.noNAs, \"long.all.noNAs.csv\")\n\nThis function will create a .csv file from the data-set you name long.all.noNAs which R will put in your working directory.\n\n\n\nMost research work involving quantitative evidence requires a big chunk of data tidying or processing before you get to the statistics. Most of the time, this is work you will have to do. The lessons you can learn about the process will generalize to many future research scenarios.\n\nIt is a mistake to think of data tidying or wrangling as an inconvenience or as an extra task or something you need to do to get to the ‘good stuff’ (your results).\n\nAll analysis results follow from and thus are determined by the data processing steps that precede analysis.\nAnalysis results can and do vary, perhaps critically, depending on different processing decisions, and reasonable people may differ on key processing decisions.\nThe process of data tidying is frequently instructive of your data recording quality: you find things out about your field measurements or your instrument integrity or quality of your recordings, when you pay attention, when you process your data.\n\n\nIt is wise to see data tidying or processing as a key part of the data analysis workflow because, as I examine in the data multiverse discussion here, the choices you make or the integrity or quality of the actions you take, will have consequences for your analysis results or, more generally, for the quality of the evidence you share with others.\nHere is a nice substack post that links to some scholarly writing and makes some excellent points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA key recommendation is that you write code to tidy or process data, thus creating a self-documented auditable data tidying process in your analysis workflow.\n\nThis is simple to do in R and that is one important reason why we use and teach R.",

    "text": "Our focus in this chapter is on analyzing data that come from studies with repeated-measures designs where the experimenter presents multiple stimuli for response to each participant.\nIn our working example, the CP reading study, CP asked all participants in her study to read a selection of words. All participants read the same selection of words, and every person read every word. For each participant, we have multiple observations and these (within-participant) observations will not be independent of each other. One participant will tend to be slower or less accurate compared to another participant, on average. Likewise, one participant’s responses will reveal a stronger (or weaker) impact of the effect of an experimental variable than another participant. These between-participant differences will tend to be apparent across the sample of participants.\nYou could say that the lowest trial-level observations can be grouped with respect to participants, that observations are nested within participant. But the data can also be grouped by stimuli. Remember that in the CP study, all participants read the same selection of words, and every person read every word. This means that for each stimulus word, there are multiple observations because all participants responded to each word, and these (within-item) observations will not be independent of each other. One word may prove to be more challenging compared to another, eliciting slower or less accurate responses, on average. Likewise, participants’ responses to a word will reveal a stronger (or weaker) impact of the effect of an experimental variable than the responses to another word. Again, these between-stimulus differences will tend to be apparent when you examine observations of responses across the sample of words.\nUnder these circumstances, are observations about the responses made by different participants nested under words, or are observations about the responses to different words nested under participants? We do not have to make a decision.\nGiven this common repeated-measures design, we can analyze the outcome variable in relation to:\n\nfixed effects: the impact of independent variables like participant reading skill or word frequency\nrandom effects: the impact of random or unexplained differences between participants and also between stimuli\n\nIn this situation, we can say that the random effects are crossed (Baayen et al., 2008). When multilevel models require the specification of crossed random effects, they tend to be called mixed-effects models.",

    "text": "To illustrate the approach, we examine observations from the CP study. We begin, as we did previously, by ignoring differences due to grouping variables (like participant or stimulus). We pretend that all observations are independent. In this fantasy situation, we address our research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: What word properties influence responses to words in a test of reading aloud?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not completed the process of tidying the CP study data then you can import the pre-tidied data here.\n\nlong.all.noNAs &lt;- read_csv(\"long.all.noNAs.csv\", \n                  col_types = cols(\n                    subjectID = col_factor(),\n                    item_name = col_factor()\n                    )\n                  ) \n\nNotice that I am using read_csv() with an additional argument col_types = cols(...).\n\nHere, I am requesting that read_csv() treats subjectID and item_name as factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe can use col_types = cols(...) to control how read_csv() interprets specific column variables in the data.\n\n\nControlling the way that read_csv() handles variables is a very useful capacity, and a more efficient way to work than, say, first reading in the data and then using coercion to ensure that variables are assigned appropriate types. You can read more about it here.\n\n\n\nWe begin our data analysis by asking if reading reaction time (RT) varies in association with word frequency. A scatterplot shows that response latencies decrease with increasing word frequency (Figure 2).\n\nlong.all.noNAs %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = Lg.UK.CDcount, y = RT)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .2) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, size = 1.5, colour=\"red\") + \n  theme_bw() + \n  xlab(\"Word frequency: log context distinctiveness (CD) count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Reading reaction time compared to word frequency, all data\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot, we see that the best fit line drawn with geom_smooth() trends downward for higher values of word frequency. This means that Figure 2 suggests that RT decreases with increasing word frequency. (I know there is a weird looking line of points around 0 but we can ignore that here.)\nWe can estimate the relationship between RT and word frequency using a linear model in which we ignore the possibility that there may be differences (between subjects, or between items) in the intercept or (between subjects) in the slope of the frequency effect. This simplified model can be stated as:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_j + e_{ij}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Y_{ij}\\) is the value of the observed outcome variable, the RT of the response made by the \\(i\\) participant to the \\(j\\) word;\n\\(\\beta_1X_j\\) refers to the fixed effect of the explanatory variable (here, word frequency), where the frequency value \\(X_j\\) is different for different words \\(j\\), and \\(\\beta_1\\) is the estimated coefficient of the effect due to the relationship between response RT and word frequency;\n\\(e_{ij}\\) is the residual error term, representing the differences between observed \\(Y_{ij}\\) and predicted values (given the model).\n\nThe linear model can be fit in R using the lm() function, as we have done previously.\n\n# label: lm-all-freq\nlm.all.1 &lt;- lm(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount, data = long.all.noNAs)\n\nsummary(lm.all.1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = RT ~ Lg.UK.CDcount, data = long.all.noNAs)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-346.62 -116.03  -38.37   62.05 1981.58 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

This means that, according to the linear model, RT decreases by about 53 milliseconds for each unit increase in log word frequency.\n\n\n\nNotice that, here, word frequency information is located in the Lg.UK.CDcount variable. In a common move for reading data analyses, we transformed the frequency estimate to the Log base 10 of the word frequency values, prior to analysis, in part because word frequency estimates are usually highly skewed.\nThe model does not explain much variance, as \\(Adjusted \\space R^2 = .03\\) but, no doubt due to the large sample, the regression model is significant overall \\(F(1,9083) = 302.8, p &lt; .001\\).\n\n\n\nVary the linear model: using different outcomes or different predictor variables.\n\nThe CP study data-set is rich with possibility. It would be useful to experiment with it.\n\nChange the predictor from frequency to something else: what do you see when you visualize the relationship between variables using scatterplots?\nSpecify linear models with different predictors: do the relationships you see in plots match the coefficients you see in the model estimates?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is that, as we have discussed, we assume that observations are independent for the linear model yet we can suppose in advance that that assumption of independence will be questionable given the expectation that participants’ responses will differ in predictable ways: one participant’s responses will perhaps be slower or less accurate than another, perhaps more or less affected by word frequency than another.\nWe can examine that variation by estimating the intercept and the slope of the frequency effect separately using the data for each participant alone. We can start by visualizing the frequency effect for each child in a grid of plots, with each plot representing the \\(\\text{RT} \\sim \\text{frequency}\\) relationship for the data for a child (Figure 3).\nWe looked at how the plotting code works step-by-step in the conceptual introduction to multilevel data.\n\nlong.all.noNAs %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Lg.UK.CDcount, y = RT)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = .2) + \n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, size = 1.25, colour = \"red\") + \n    theme_bw() + \n    xlab(\"Word frequency (log10 UK SUBTLEX CD count)\") + \n    facet_wrap(~ subjectID)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: RT vs. word frequency, considered separately for data for each child\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows how, on average, more frequent words are associated with shorter reaction time: faster responses. The plot further shows, however, that the effect of frequency varies considerably between children.\n\nSome children show little or no effect; the best fit line is practically level.\nSome children show a marked effect, with a steep fit line indicating a strong frequency effect.\n\nWe can get more insight into the differences between children if we plot the estimated intercept and frequency effect coefficients for each child directly. This allows more insight because it focuses the eye on the differences between children in the estimates. We do this next: see Figure 4. (I work through the code for generating the plot in: 02-mixed-workbook-with-answers.R)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Estimated intercepts and frequency effect slopes calculated for each child’s data, with child data analysed separately for all children. Points represent estimates. Lines represent standard errors for estimates. Point estimates are presented in order of size.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 presents two plots showing the estimates of the intercept and the coefficient of the effect of word frequency on reading RT, calculated separately for each child. This means that we fitted a separate linear model, for the association between RT and frequency, using the data for just one child, for each child in our sample, for all the children.\nThe estimate for each child is shown as a black dot. The standard error of the estimate is shown as a black vertical line, shown above and below a point. You can say that where there is a longer line there we have more uncertainty about the location of the estimate.\nThe estimates calculated for each child are shown ordered from left to right in the plot by the size of the estimate. This adjustment to the plot reveals how the estimates of both the intercept and the slope of the frequency effect vary substantially between children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe first key observation is that if there is an average intercept for everyone in the sample or, better, an intercept we could estimate for everyone in the population, then the different intercepts we have estimated for each child would be distributed around that population-level average:\n\nSome children will have slower (here, larger) intercepts\nand other children will have faster (shorter) intercepts.\n\n\n\nHere, the intercept can be taken to be the average RT when all other effects in the model are set to zero. RT varies for this sample around somewhere like \\(\\beta_0 = 883ms\\) so a slower larger intercept might be e.g. \\(\\beta_0 = 1000ms\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe second key observation is that if there is an average slope for the frequency effect, an effect of frequency on reading RT, averaged across everyone in the population, then, again, the different slopes we have estimated for each child would be distributed around that population-level effect.\n\nSome children will have larger (here, more negative) frequency effects\nand other children will have smaller (less negative) frequency effects.\n\n\n\nHere, the frequency effect is associated with a negative coefficient e.g. \\(\\beta_1 = -53\\) so a larger frequency effect will be a bigger negative number e.g. \\(\\beta_1 = -100\\).\n\n\n\nIn a mixed-effects model, we account for this variation: the differences between participants in intercepts and slopes.\nWe do this by modeling the intercept as two terms:\n\\[\n\\beta_{0i} = \\gamma_0 + U_{0i}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma_0\\) is the average intercept and \\(U_{0i}\\) is the difference for each \\(i\\) child between their intercept and the average intercept.\n\nWe model the frequency effect as two terms:\n\\[\n\\beta_{1i} = \\gamma_1 + U_{1i}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma_1\\) is the average slope and \\(U_{1i}\\) represents the difference for each \\(i\\) child between the slope of their frequency effect and the average slope.\n\nWe can then incorporate in a single model the fixed effects due to the average intercept and the average frequency effect, as well as the random effects, error variance due to unexplained differences between participants in intercepts and frequency effects:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1X_j + U_{0i}+ U_{1i}X_j + e_{ij}\n\\]\n\nwhere the outcome \\(Y_{ij}\\) is related to …\nthe average intercept \\(\\gamma_0\\) and differences between \\(i\\) children in the intercept \\(U_{0i}\\);\nthe average effect of the explanatory variable frequency \\(\\gamma_1X_j\\) and differences between \\(i\\) participants in the slope \\(U_{1i}X_j\\);\nin addition to residual error variance \\(e_{ij}\\).\n\n\n\nIn sections Section 1.9.7 and Section 1.11, we look at what exactly is captured in these random effects terms \\(U_{0i}, U_{1i}\\). Let’s first look at the practicalities of analysis then come back to deepen our understanding a bit more.\nRight now, it is important to understand that in our analysis we do not care about the differences between specific children. We care that there are differences. And we care how widely spread are the differences between child A and the average intercept (or slope), or between child B and the average intercept (or slope), or between child C … (you get the idea). Therefore, in our analysis, we estimate the spread of the differences as a variance term. We can see this when we look at the results of the mixed-effects model we specify, next.\n\n\n\n\nWe can fit a mixed-effects model of the \\(\\text{RT} \\sim \\text{frequency}\\) relationship, taking into account the random differences between participants. I first go through the model fitting code bit by bit. (I go through the output, the results, in Section 1.9.6.)\n\nlmer.all.1 &lt;- lmer(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + \n                         (Lg.UK.CDcount + 1||subjectID),\n             \n             data = long.all.noNAs)\n\nsummary(lmer.all.1)\n\nYou have seen the lmer() function code before but practice makes perfect so we shall go through the code step by step, as we did previously.\nFirst, we have a chunk of code mostly similar to what we do when we do a regression analysis.\n\nlmer.all.1 &lt;- lmer(...) creates a linear mixed-effects model object using the lmer() function.\nRT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount is a formula expressing the model in which we estimate the fixed effect on the outcome or dependent variable RT (reaction time, in milliseconds) as predicted \\(\\sim\\) by the independent or predictor variable Lg.UK.CDcount (word frequency).\n...(..., data = long.all.noNAs) specifies the data-set in which you can find the variables named in the model fitting code.\nsummary(lmer.all.1) gets a summary of the fitted model object, showing you the results.\n\nSecond, we have the bit that is specific to multilevel or mixed-effects models.\n\nWe add (...||subjectID) to tell R about the random effects corresponding to random differences between sample groups (here, observations grouped by child) that are coded by the subjectID variable.\n(...1 ||subjectID) says that we want to estimate random differences between sample groups (observations by child) in intercepts, where the intercept is coded by 1.\n(Lg.UK.CDcount... ||subjectID) adds random differences between sample groups (observations by child) in slopes of the frequency effect coded using the Lg.UK.CDcount variable name.\n\n\n\nIt will help your learning if you now go back and compare this model with the model you saw in the conceptual introduction to multilevel data.\n\nIdentify what is different: data-set, variable names, and model formula.\nIdentify what stays the same: function name … the specification of both model and random effects.\n\nIf you can see what is different versus what stays the same then you learn what you can change when the time comes for your analysis with your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLearning to look at example code so that you can identify how to adapt it for your own purposes is a key skill in psychological data science.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we move on, I want you to notice something that looks like nothing much: ||.\nWe are going to need to defer until later a (necessary) discussion of exactly why we need the two double lines. In short, the use of || asks R to fit a model in which we estimate random effects associated with:\n\nvariance due to differences in intercepts\nvariance due to differences in slopes\nbut not covariance between the two sets of differences\n\nI do this because otherwise the model I specify will not converge.\nWe shall need to discuss these things: convergence, and failures to converge; as well as random effects specification and simplification. We will discuss random effects covariance in Section 1.11. For now, the most important lesson is learnt by seeing how the analysis approach we saw last week can be extended to examining the effects of experimental variables in data from repeated measures design studies.\n\n\n\n\nThe lmer() model code we discussed in Section 1.9.5 gives us the following output.\n\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: RT ~ Lg.UK.CDcount + ((1 | subjectID) + (0 + Lg.UK.CDcount |  \n    subjectID))\n   Data: long.all.noNAs\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 117805.3\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.7839 -0.5568 -0.1659  0.3040 12.4850 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups      Name          Variance Std.Dev.\n subjectID   (Intercept)   87575    295.93  \n subjectID.1 Lg.UK.CDcount  2657     51.55  \n Residual                  23734    154.06  \nNumber of obs: 9085, groups:  subjectID, 61\n\nFixed effects:\n              Estimate Std.

We expand on that discussion, a little, here.\nThe output from the model summary first gives us information about the model.\n\nFirst, we see information about the function used to fit the model, and the model object created by the lmer() function call.\nThen, we see the model formula RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + (Lg.UK.CDcount + 1|subjectID).\nThen, we see REML criterion at convergence about the model fitting process, which we can usually ignore.\nThen, we see information about the distribution of the model residuals.\nWe then see information listed under Random effects: this is where you can see information about the error variance terms estimated by the model.\n\n\nThe information is listed in four columns: 1. Groups; 2. Name; 3. Variance; and 4. Std.Dev.\n\nWe have discussed how observations can be grouped by participant (because we have multiple response observations for each person in the study) just as previously we identified how observations could be grouped by class (because we saw that children were nested under class). That is what we mean when we refer to Groups: we are identifying the grouping variables that give hierarchical structure to the data.\n\nThe Name lists whether the estimate we are looking at corresponds to, here, random differences between participants in intercepts (listed as (Intercept)), or in slopes (listed as Lg.UK.CDcount).\n\nAs we discuss later, in Section 1.11, mixed-effects models estimate the spread in random differences. We are not interested in the specific differences in intercept or slope between specific individuals. What we want is to be able to take into account the variance associated with those differences.\nThus, we see in the Random Effects section, the variances associated with:\n\nsubjectID Intercept) 87575, differences between participants in the intercepts;\nsubjectID.1 Lg.UK.CDcount 2657, differences between participants in the slopes of the frequency effect;\nAlongside Residual  23734, residuals where, just like a linear model, we have variance associated with differences between model estimates and observed RT, here, at the trial level.\n\nWe do not usually discuss the specific variance estimates in research reports. However, the relative size of the variances does provide useful information (Meteyard & Davies, 2020), as we shall see when we discuss the different estimates we get when we include a random effect due to differences between items (Section 1.10.2).\n\nLastly, we see estimates of the coefficients (of the slopes) of the fixed effects.\n\nIn this model, we see estimates of the fixed effects of the intercept and the slope of the RT ~ Lg.UK.CDcount model. We discuss these estimates next.\n\n\nRecall that the linear model yields the estimate for the frequency effect on reading RT such that RT decreases by about 53 ms for unit increase in log word frequency (\\(\\beta = -53.375\\)). Now, when we have taken random differences between participants into account, we see that the estimate of the effect for the mixed-effects model is \\(\\beta = -67.980\\). Taking into account random differences clearly has an impact on results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: What word properties influence responses to words in a test of reading aloud?\nResult: The mixed-effect analysis shows that RT decreases by about \\(68\\) milliseconds for each unit increase in log word frequency.\n\n\n\nWhich coefficient estimate should you trust? Well, it is obvious that the linear model and the linear mixed-effects model estimate are relatively similar. However, it is also obvious that the linear model makes an assumption – the assumption of independence of observations – that does not make sense theoretically (because reading responses will be similar for each child) and does not make sense empirically (because responses will differ between children, see Figure 4). Thus, we have good grounds for supposing that the linear mixed-effects model estimate for the frequency effect is likely to be closer to the true underlying population effect.\nIt is important to remember, however, that whatever estimate we can produce is the estimate given the sample of words we used, our information about word frequency, and our measurement of reading RT responses. How far our estimate actually generalizes to the wider population is not something we can judge in the context of a single study.\nFurther, we have not finished in our consideration of the random effects that the account should include. We need to do more work by thinking about the differences between stimuli (Section 1.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhy aren’t there p-values?\nWe will come back to this (in a week) but note that if \\(t &gt; 2\\) we can suppose that an effect is significant at the \\(.05\\) significance level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have said that we can incorporate, in a mixed-effects model, fixed effects (e.g., the average frequency effect) and random effects, error variance due to unexplained differences between participants in intercepts and in frequency effects:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1X_j + U_{0i}+ U_{1i}X_j + e_{ij}\n\\]\nSo we distinguish:\n\nthe average intercept \\(\\gamma_0\\) and differences between \\(i\\) children in the intercept \\(U_{0i}\\);\nthe average effect of the explanatory variable frequency \\(\\gamma_1X_j\\) and differences between \\(i\\) participants in the slope \\(U_{1i}X_j\\).\n\nWhen we think about the differences between participants (or between the units of any grouping variable), in intercepts or in slopes, we typically assume that the differences are:\n\nrandom;\nshould be normally distributed;\nand are distributed around the population or average fixed effects.\n\nWe can say that the mixed-effects model sees the differences between participants relative to the fixed effect intercept or slope, that is, relative to the population level or average effects.\nWe can illustrate this by plotting, in Figure 5, the differences as estimated – technically, predicted – by the mixed-effects model that we have been examining. (The code for producing the plot can be found in 02-mixed-workbook-answers.R.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Plot showing histograms indicating the distribution of participant adjustments to account for between-child differences in intercept or slope (the Best Linear Unbiased Predictions).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you can see in Figure 5 are distributions, presented using histograms. The centers of the distributions are located at zero (shown by a red line). For each distribution (a. and b.), that is where the model estimate of the intercept or the slope of the frequency effect is located. Spread around that central point, you see the adjustments the model makes to account for differences between participants.\nNotice how, in Figure 5 (a.):\n\nSome children have intercepts that are smaller than the population-level or average intercept – so their adjustments are negative (to decrease their intercepts).\nSome children have intercepts that are larger than the population-level or average intercept – so their adjustments are positive (to increase their intercepts).\n\n\nStrikingly, you can see that a few children have intercepts that are as much as 1000ms larger than the population-level or average intercept: the bars representing the estimates for these children are far out on the right of the x-axis in Figure 5 (a.).\n\nNow notice how, in Figure 5 (b.):\n\nSome children have frequency effects (coefficients) that are smaller than the population-level or average frequency effect – so their adjustments are positive (to decrease their frequency effect, by making it less negative).\nSome children have frequency effects that are larger than the population-level or average frequency effect – so their adjustments are negative (to increase their frequency effect, by making it more negative).\n\n(When you look at Figure 5 (b.), remember that the estimated \\(\\beta\\) coefficient for the frequency effect is negative because higher word frequency is associated with smaller RT.)\n\nStrikingly, you can see that a few children have frequency effects that are as much as 200ms larger (see plot (b.) around \\(x = -200\\)) than the population-level or average effect.\n\nWhen a mixed-effects model is fitted to a data-set, its set of estimated parameters includes the coefficients for the fixed effects as well as the standard deviations for the random effects (Baayen et al., 2008). If you read the literature on mixed-effects models, you will see that the adjustments are called Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs).\n\n\nMixed-effects modeling is hard to get used to at first. A bit more practice helps to show you how the different parts of the model work. We again focus on the random effects.\nIn the model we have seen so far, we specify (Lg.UK.CDcount + 1||subjectID)\n\nWe can change this part – and only this part – to see what happens to the results. Do it: rerun the model code, having changed the random effects part:\n\n\nlmer(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + (1|subjectID)...) gives us a random intercepts model accounting for just random differences between participants in the intercept\nlmer(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + (Lg.UK.CDcount + 0|subjectID)...) gives us a random slope model accounting for just random differences between participants in the slope of the frequency effect\nlmer(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + (Lg.UK.CDcount + 1|subjectID)...) gives us a random intercepts and slopes model accounting for both random differences between participants in the intercept and in the slope, as well as covariance in these differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTry out these variations and look carefully at the different results. Look, especially, at what happens to the Random effects part of the summary.\n\n\nThis will be an important and revealing exercise.\nWe can visualize the differences between the models in a plot showing the different predictions that the different models give us. Figure 6 shows what a mixed-effects model predicts are the effects of frequency on RT for different children in the CP study.\n\nThe predictions vary depending on the nature of the random effects we specify in the model.\n\n(Note that I figured out how to produce the plot from the information here.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Plot showing model predictions of the effect, for each individual, of word frequency on reading reaction time – predictions vary between models incorporating (a.) random effect of participants on intercepts only; (b.) random effect of participants on slopes only and (c.) random effect of participants on intercepts and on slopes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that:\n\nIf the model includes the random effect of participants on intercepts only then all the slopes are the same (the lines in the figure are parallel) because this model assumes that the only differences between participants are differences in the intercepts.\nIf the model includes the random effect of participants on slopes only then the slopes vary but they all have the same intercept. The plot does not show this but you can see how all the slopes are converging on one point somewhere on the left. This happens because this model assumes that the only differences between participants are differences in the slopes.\nIf the model includes the random effect of participants on intercepts and on slopes then we can see how the intercepts and the slopes vary. Given what we saw when we looked at the relation between frequency and RT for each participant considered separately we might argue that this model is much more realistic about the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is key to your skills development that you learn to make effective use of the warnings and error messages R can produce.\n\n\nYou do not have to just believe me when I say that || is in the model code to stop a problem appearing.\n\nExperiment – and see what happens when you change the code.

    "text": "Important\n\n\n\nExperimental psychologists will often collect data in studies where they present some stimuli to a sample of participants.\n\n\nClark (1973) showed that the appropriate analysis of experimental effects for such data requires the researcher to take into account the error variance due to unexplained or random differences between sampled participants and also to random differences between sampled stimuli. This is true in the context of psycholinguistics but it is also true in the context of work in any field where the presented stimuli can be understood to constitute a sample from a wider population of potential stimuli (e.g., stories about social situations, Judd et al., 2012).\nIf we were to estimate the average latency of the responses made by different children to each word, in the CP study data, we would see that there is considerable variation between words. We do this in Figure 7. (I work through the code for producing the plot in 02-mixed-workbook-answers.R.)\n\nSome words elicit slower and some elicit faster responses on average.\nWe can also see that there is, again, variation in the uncertainty of estimates, as reflected in differences in the lengths of the error bars corresponding to the standard errors of the estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Estimated intercepts (with SEs) calculated for each stimulus word, with coefficients ordered by average latency for each word\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, psychologists have been aware since Clark (1973) (if not earlier) that responses to experimental stimuli can vary because of random or unexplained differences between the stimuli: whether the stimuli are words, pictures or stories, etc. And researchers have been aware that if we did not take such variation into account, we might mistakenly detect an experimental effect, for example, as a significant difference between mean response in different conditions, simply because different stimuli presented in different conditions varied in some unknown way, randomly.\nFor many years, psychologists tried to take random differences between stimuli into account, alongside random differences between participants, using a variety of strategies with important limitations (see Baayen et al. (2008), for discussion). Clark (1973) suggested that researchers could calculate \\(minF'\\) (not F) when doing Analyses of Variance of experimental data\nThis involves a series of steps.\n\nYou start by aggregating your data\n\n\nBy-subjects data – for each subject, take the average of their responses to all the items\nBy-items data – for each item, take the average of all subjects’ responses to that item\n\n\nYou do separate ANOVAs, one for by-subjects (F1) data and one for by-items (F2) data\nYou put F1 and F2 together, calculating minF’\n\nAveraging data by-subjects or by-items is relatively simple. It is very common to see, in the literature, psychological reports in which F1 and F2 analysis results are presented (that is why I am explaining this).\nCalculating \\(minF'\\) is also relatively simple:\n\\[\nminF' = \\frac{MS_{effect}}{MS_{\\text{random-subject-effects}} + MS_{\\text{random-word-differences}}} = \\frac{F_1F_2}{F_1 + F_2}\n\\]\nHowever, after a while, psychologists stopped doing the extra step of the \\(minF'\\) calculation (Raaijmakers et al., 1999). They carried on calculating and reporting F1 and F2 ANOVA results but, as Baayen et al. (2008) discuss, that approach risks a high false positive error rate.\nPsychologists also found that while the \\(minF'\\) approach allowed them to take into account between-participant and between-stimulus differences it could not be applied where ANOVA could not be used. This stopped researchers from taking a comprehensive approach to error variance where they wanted to conduct multiple regression analyses.\nIn the psychological literature, you will often see multiple regression analyses of by-items data, where a sample of participants has been asked to respond to a sample of stimuli, and the analysis is of the effects of stimulus properties on outcomes averaged (over participants’ responses) to the mean outcome by item. The problem is that analyzing data only by-items ensures that we lose track of participant differences.\nLorch & Myers (1990) warn that analyzing only by-items mean RTs just assumes wrongly that subjects are a fixed effect. This approach, again, risks a higher rate of false positive errors.\n\n\nThe good thing is that, thanks to the advent of mixed-effects models, we now no longer need to tolerate these problems.\nIn the context of our working example, in our analysis of the CP study data, we can build up our mixed-effects model by adding a random effect to capture the impact of unexplained differences between stimuli.\nWe model the random effect of items on intercepts by modeling the intercept as two terms:\n\\[\n\\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_0 + W_{0j}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\gamma_0\\) is the average intercept and \\(W_{0j}\\) represents the deviation, for each word, between the average intercept and the per-word intercept.\n\nOur model can now incorporate the additional random effect of items on intercepts:\n\\[\nY_{ij} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1X_j + U_{0i}+ U_{1i}X_j + W_{0j} + e_{ij}\n\\]\nIn this model, the outcome \\(Y_{ij}\\) is related to:\n\nthe average intercept \\(\\gamma_0\\) and the word frequency effect \\(\\gamma_1X_j\\)\nplus random effects due to unexplained differences between participants in intercepts \\(U_{0i}\\) and the slope of the frequency effect \\(U_{1i}X_j\\)\nas well as random differences between items in intercepts \\(W_{0j}\\),\nin addition to the residual term \\(e_{ij}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhat about random effects associated with differences between stimulus items in the slopes of effects?\n\nJust as we may expect there to be between-participant differences in the slope of the word frequency effect, we may expect there to be between-stimulus differences in the slope of the effect of, e.g., participant age.\nRest assured, we will look at this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can fit a mixed-effects model of the \\(\\text{RT} \\sim \\text{frequency}\\) relationship, taking into account the random differences between participants and now also the random differences between stimulus words.\n\nlmer.all.2 &lt;- lmer(RT ~  Lg.UK.CDcount + \n                         (Lg.UK.CDcount + 1||subjectID) +\n                         (1|item_name),\n             \n             data = long.all.noNAs)\n\nsummary(lmer.all.2)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: RT ~ Lg.UK.CDcount + ((1 | subjectID) + (0 + Lg.UK.CDcount |  \n    subjectID)) + (1 | item_name)\n   Data: long.all.noNAs\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 116976.7\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.1795 -0.5474 -0.1646  0.3058 12.9485 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups      Name          Variance Std.Dev.\n item_name   (Intercept)     3397    58.29  \n subjectID   Lg.UK.CDcount   3624    60.20  \n subjectID.1 (Intercept)   112314   335.13  \n Residual                   20704   143.89  \nNumber of obs: 9085, groups:  item_name, 159; subjectID, 61\n\nFixed effects:\n              Estimate Std.

You should notice three changes.\n\nYou can see that the estimate for the effect of word frequency on reading reaction time has changed again, it is now \\(\\beta = -72.33\\)\nitem_name   (Intercept)     3397 there is now an additional term in the list of random effects, giving the model estimate for variance associated with random differences between words in intercepts\nAnd you can see that the residual variance has changed. In the first model lmer.all.1 it was 23734, now it is 20704\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe reduction in residual variance is one way in which we can judge how good a job the model is doing in accounting for the variance in the outcome, observed response reaction time.\n\n\nWe can see that by adding a term to account for differences between items we can reduce the amount by which the model estimates deviate from observed outcomes. This difference in error variance is, essentially, one basis for estimating how well the model fits the data, and a basis for estimating the variance explained by a model in terms of the \\(R^2\\) statistic you have seen before.\nWe will come back to this.",

    "text": "As I have said, we usually do not aim to examine the specific deviation from the average intercept or the average fixed effect slope for a participant or stimulus. We estimate just the spread of deviations by-participants or by-items.\nA mixed-effects model like our final model includes fixed effects corresponding to the intercept and the slope of the word frequency effect plus the variances:\n\n\\(var(U_{0i})\\) variance of deviations by-participants from the average intercept;\n\\(var(U_{1i}X_j)\\) variance of deviations by-participants from the average slope of the frequency effect;\n\\(var(W_{0j})\\) variance of deviations by-items from the average intercept;\n\\(var(e_{ij})\\) residuals, at the response level, after taking into account all other terms.\n\nBecause we have variances, we may expect the random effects of participants or items to covary, e.g., participants who are slow to respond may also be more susceptible to the frequency effect, as can be seen in Figure 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Scatterplot showing the relationship between estimated coefficients for the intercept and for the frequency effect, for each child analysed separately\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is why it would often make sense to specify, among the random effects of the model, terms corresponding to the covariance of the random effects:\n\n\\(covar(U_{0i}, U_{1i}X_j)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember we excluded random effects covariance using ||.\n\n\nIn Section 1.9.5.2, I noted how we used the || notation to stop the model estimating the covariance between differences between participants in intercepts and in slopes. The reason I did this is that if I had requested that the model estimate the covariance the model would have failed to converge. What this means depends on understanding how mixed-effects models are estimated. We shall have to return to a development of that understanding later. For now, it is enough to note that mixed-effects models fitted with lmer() often have more difficulty with random effects covariance estimates.",

    "text": "A large proportion of psychological studies involves scenarios in which the researcher samples both participants and some kind of stimuli. Often, the researcher will present the stimuli to the participants for response in some version of a range of possible designs:\n\nall participants see and respond to all stimuli;\nparticipants respond to different sub-sets of stimuli in different conditions (or in different groups) but they see and respond to all stimuli in a sub-set;\nparticipants are allocated to respond to stimulus sub-sets according to a counter balancing scheme (e.g., through the use of Latin squares).\n\nWhatever version of this scenario, if participants are responding to multiple stimuli and if multiple partcipants respond to each stimulus, then the data will have a multilevel structure such that each observation can be grouped both by participant and by stimulus.\nWe are interested in taking into account the random effects associated with unexplained or random differences between participants or between stimuli. We often discuss the accounting of these effects in terms of the estimation of error variances associated with the random differences, calling the effects of the differences random effects. Where we have to deal with both samples of participants and samples of stimuli, we can talk about crossed random effects.\nThe terms are not that important. The insight is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn general, in experimental psychological science, when we do data analysis, if we want to estimate effects of experimental variables more accurately then our models need to incorporate terms to capture the impact on observed outcomes of sampled participants and sampled stimuli.\n\n\nHistorically, we have, as a field, learned to take into account these sampling effects. Now, and most likely, more and more commonly in the future, we are learning to use multilevel or mixed-effects models to do this.\n\n\n\n\nWe discussed the way that data are structured when they come from studies with repeated measures designs. Critically, we examined data from a common study design where a sample of stimulus items are presented for response to members of a participant sample. This means that each observation can be grouped by participant and, also, by stimulus. The possibility that observations can be grouped means that the data have a multilevel structure.\nThe multilevel structure requires the use of linear mixed-effects models when we seek to estimate the effects of experimental variables. The fact that data can be grouped both by participant and by stimulus means that the model can incorporate random effects to capture random between-participant differences as well as between-stimulus differences.\nThe use of mixed-effects models has meant that psychologists no longer need to adopt compromise solutions which have important limitations, like by-items and by-subjects analyses.\n\n\n\nWe reviewed the ways that experimental data can be untidy. And we outlined the steps that may be required to process untidy data into a tidy format suitable for analysis. As is typical for the data analysis we need to do for experimental psychological science, getting data ready for analysis requires a series of steps including: access; import; restructure; select variables; and filter observations.\nWe then developed a mixed-effects model to answer the question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nResearch question: What word properties influence responses to words in a test of reading aloud?\n\n\n\nOur analysis focused on the relationship between reading response reaction time (RT, in ms) and the predictor word frequency. We examined how the effect of word frequency was estimated in a linear model ignoring the multilevel structure and then in mixed-effects models which incorporated terms to capture:\n\nvariance associated with random differences between participants in intercepts or in the slope of the frequency effect,\nvariance associated with random differences between items in intercepts.\n\nWe saw that estimates of the frequency effect differed between different models.\n\n\n\n\nWe used a number of functions to tidy and visualize the CP study data.\n\nread_csv() and read_csv() to load source data files into the R workspace\npivot_longer() to restructure data from wide to long\nfull_join() to put together data from separate data-sets; in our example, from data-sets holding information about participant attributes, stimulus word properties, and participant behaviours\nselect() to select the variables we need\nfilter() to filter observations based on conditions\nna.omit() to remove missing values\nFor visualisation, we used facet_wrap() to show plots of the relationship between outcome and predictor variables separately for different groups (by participant, or by item)\n\nFor our analyses:\n\nWe used lmer() to fit a multilevel model.\n\nWe used the summary() function to get model results for both linear models and for the mulilevel or liner mixed-effects model.",

    "text": "Welcome to your overview of the work we will do together in Week 17.\nMany Psychologists conduct studies with repeated-measures designs where the experimenter presents a sample of multiple stimuli, for response, to each participant in a sample of multiple participants. Studies with repeated-measures designs will produce data with a structure that requires the use of mixed-effects models.\nWe are going to learn about this kind of data, and build on the analysis methods we learned about in the conceptual introduction to multilevel data and the workbook introduction to multilevel data.\nWe use the same procedure we did for multilevel data but with one significant change which we shall explore and seek to understand in-depth.\n\n\nOur learning objectives again include the development of both concepts and skills.\n\nskills – practice how to tidy experimental data for mixed-effects analysis.\nconcepts – begin to develop an understanding of crossed random effects of participants and stimuli.\nskills and concepts – practice fitting linear mixed-effects models incorporating random effects of participants and stimuli.\n\n\n\n\nYou will see, next, the lectures we share to explain the concepts you will learn about, and the practical data analysis skills you will develop. Then you will see information about the practical materials you can use to build and practise your skills.\nEvery week, you will learn best if you first watch the lectures then do the practical exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinked resources\n\n\n\nTo help your learning, you can read about the ideas and the practical coding required for analyses in the chapters I wrote for this course.\n\nThe chapter: Introduction to linear mixed-effects models\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lecture materials for this week are presented in three short parts.\nClick on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part.\n\nPart 1 (17 minutes) Mixed-effects models: Repeated measures data and the what, when and how of mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\nPart 2 (21 minutes): Working with an example from a study with a repeated measures design, recognizing how people or how stimuli vary, and identifying the motivation for using mixed-effects models, compared to alternative methods.\n\n\n\nPart 3 (15 minutes): What mixed-effects models can do for us, how we can describe the logic, how we code mixed-effects models, what the bits of code do, what the results look like, what the results tell us, and how we should report our models and our findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the lecture slides\n\n\n\nThe slides presented in the videos can be downloaded here:\n\n402-week-18-LME-2.pdf: high resolution .pdf, exactly as delivered [6 MB];\n402-week-18-LME-2_1pp-lo.pdf: lower resolution .pdf, printable version, one-slide-per-page [about 900 KB];\n402-week-18-LME-2_6pp-lo.pdf: lower resolution .pdf, printable version, six-slides-per-page [about 900 KB].\n\nThe high resolution version is the version delivered for the lecture recordings. Because the images are produced to be high resolution, the file size is quite big (6 MB) so, to make the slides easier to download, I produced low resolution versions: 1pp and 6pp. These should be easier to download and print out if that is what you want to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be working with the CP reading study data-set. CP tested 62 children (aged 116-151 months) on reading aloud in English. In the experimental reading task, CP presented 160 words as stimuli. The same 160 words were presented to all children. The words were presented one at a time on a computer screen. Each time a word was shown, each child had to read the word out loud and their response was recorded. Thus, the CP reading study data-set comprised observations about the responses made by 62 children to 160 words.\nYou can read more about these data in the chapter: Introduction to linear mixed-effects models.\nThe critical features of the study are that:\n\nWe have an outcome measure – the reading response – observed multiple times.\n\n\nWe have multiple responses recorded for each participant: they make one response to each stimulus (here, each stimulus word), for the multiple stimuli that they see in the experimental reading task.\nAnd we have multiple responses recorded for each stimulus: one response is made to each stimulus by each participant, for all the participants who completed the task, in a sample of multiple participants.\n\nThe presence of these features is the reason why we need to use mixed-effects models in our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the data: get the data file and the .R script you can use to do the exercises that will support your learning.\n\nYou can download the files folder for this chapter by clicking on the link 02-mixed.zip.\n\n\n\nThe practical materials folder includes data files and an .R script:\n\nCP study word naming rt 180211.dat\nCP study word naming acc 180211.dat\nwords.items.5 120714 150916.csv\nall.subjects 110614-050316-290518.csv\nlong.all.noNAs.csv\n402-02-mixed-workbook.R the workbook you will need to do the practical exercises.\n\nThe .dat files are tab delimited files holding behavioural data: the latency or reaction time rt (in milliseconds) and the accuracy acc of response made by each participant to each stimulus.\nThe .csv files are comma separated values files.

The all.subjects file holds information about the 62 participants who volunteered to take part in the experiment.\nIn the following, I will describe a series of steps through which we get the data ready for analysis.

Can you identify the differences between the functions used to read different kinds of data files?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThese different functions respect the different ways in which the .dat and .csv file formats work.\n\nWe need read_tsv() when data files consist of tab separated values.\nWe need read_csv() when data files consist of comma separated values.\n\nYou can read more about the {tidyverse} {readr} library of helpful functions here.\nIt is very common to get experimental data in all sorts of different formats. Learning to use tidyverse functions will make it easier to cope with this when you do research.\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.2. Can you explain what the read_ functions are doing, or what you are doing with them when you code them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will help your understanding to examine an example. Take a look at what this line of code includes, element by element.\n\nbehaviour.rt &lt;- read_tsv(\"CP study word naming rt 180211.dat\", na = \"-999\")\n\n\nWe write behaviour.rt &lt;- read_tsv(...) to create an object in the R environment, which we call behaviour.rt: the object with this name is the data-set we read into R using read_tsv(...).\nWhen we write the function read_tsv(...) we include two arguments inside it.\nread_tsv(\"CP study word naming rt 180211.dat\", ... first, the name of the file, given in quotes \"\" and then a comma.\nread_tsv(..., na = \"-999\") second, we tell R that there are some missing values na which are coded with the value \"-999\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidying the data involves a number of tasks, some essential and some things we do for our convenience.\n\n\nTo get ready for later analyses, we need to ensure that reaction time (rt) and accuracy (acc) observations are in tidy format.\nWhen we first encounter the data files, the data are untidy because, here, the reaction time (rt) and accuracy (acc) observations are in separate multiple columns. We pivot the data to solve this problem.\n\nYou can read more about what we are doing and why, here, in the chapter: Introduction to linear mixed-effects models.\n\n\nPract.Q.3. How do we do this?\n\n\nYou can try out some solutions, based on what you have done before.\nYou can open the Hint box for a detailed walk-through of the process, and then adapt the hint information.\nAnd you can open the Code box for the example code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use a function you may have seen before: pivot_longer().\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n             pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\nThe name of the function comes from the fact that we are starting with data in wide format e.g. behaviour.rt where we have what should be a single variable of observations (RTs) arranged in a wide series of multiple columns, side-by-side (one column for each participant). But we want to take those wide data and lengthen the data-set, increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.\nLet’s look at this line of code bit by bit.\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n\n\nAt the start, I tell R that I am going to create a new longer data-set (more rows, fewer columns) that I shall call rt.long.\nI will create this longer data-set from &lt;- the original wide data-set behaviour.rt.\nand I will create the new longer data-set by taking the original wide data-set and piping it %&gt;% to the pivot function coded on the next line:\n\n\npivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\n\nOn this next line, I tell R how to do the pivoting by using three arguments.\n\n\npivot_longer(2:62...)\n\n\nFirst, I tell R that I want to re-arrange all the columns that can be found in the data-set from the second column to the sixty-second column.\nIn a spreadsheet, we have a number of columns.\nColumns can be identified by their position in the spreadsheet.\nThe position of a column in a spreadsheet can be identified by number, from the leftmost column (column number 1) to the rightmost column (here, column number 62) in our data-set.\nSo this argument tells R exactly which columns I want to pivot.\n\n\npivot_longer(..., names_to = \"subjectID\", ...)\n\n\nSecond, I tell R that I want it to take the column labels and put them into a new column, called subjectID.\nIn the wide data-set behaviour.rt, each column holds a list of numbers (RTs) but begins with a word in the topmost cell, the name code for a participant, in the column label position.\nWe want to keep the information about which participant produces which response when we pivot the wide data to a longer structure.\nWe do this by asking R to take the column labels (the participant names) and listing them in a new column, called subjectID which now holds the names as participant ID codes.\n\n\npivot_longer(...values_to = \"RT\")\n\n\nThird, we tell R that all the RT values should be put in a single column.\nWe can understand that this new column RT will hold RT observations in a vertical stack, one cell for each response by a person to a word, with rows ordered by subjectID.\n\nThere are 61 columns of data listed by participant though 62 children were tested because we lost one child’s data through an administrative error. As a result, in the wide data sets there are 62 columns, with the first column holding item_name data.\nYou can find more information about pivoting data here\nAnd you can find more information specifically about the pivot_longer() operation here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n             pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\nacc.long &lt;- behaviour.acc %&gt;%\n              pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer our research question, we next need to combine the RT with the accuracy data, and then the combined behavioural data with participant information and with stimulus information.\nIn common practice, in psychological research, we have to deal with the fact that information about behavioural responses, and about participant attributes or stimulus word properties, are located in separate files.\nThis is a problem where we need, as here, to analyse outcome behavioural responses using information about participant attributes or stimulus word properties.\n\nPract.Q.4. How do we solve this problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to join the data from the different sources:\n\njoin RT with accuracy then\njoin those response data with data about subject attributes\nthen join those response plus subjects data\nwith item properties data\n\nWe can combine the data-sets, in the way that we need, using the {tidyverse} full_join() function.\n\n\n\nFirst, we join RT and accuracy data together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;% \n          full_join(acc.long)\n\n\n\n\nThen, we join subject and item information to the behavioural data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlong.subjects &lt;- long %&gt;% \n                   full_join(subjects, by = \"subjectID\")\n\nlong.all &lt;- long.subjects %&gt;%\n              full_join(words, by = \"item_name\")\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.4. Can you explain what you are doing, or what the code you use is doing, to solve the problem of putting the separate sets of data together?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, in a series of steps, we take one data-set and join it (merge it) with the second data-set. Let’s look at an example element by element to better understand how this is accomplished.\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;% \n           full_join(acc.long)\n\nThe code work as follows.\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;%\n\n\nWe create a new data-set we call long.\nWe do this by taking one original data-set rt.long and %&gt;% piping it to the operation defined in the second step.\n\n\nfull_join(acc.long)\n\n\nIn this second step, we use the function full_join() to add observations from a second original data-set acc.long to those already from rt.long\n\nThe addition of observations from one data-set joining to those from another happens through a matching process.\n\nR looks at the data-sets being merged.\nIt identifies if the two data-sets have columns in common. Here, the data-sets have subjectID and item_name in common).\nR can use these common columns to identify rows of data. Here, each row of data will be identified by both subjectID and item_name i.e. as data about the response made by a participant to a word.\nR will then do a series of identity checks, comparing one data-set with the other and, row by row, looking for matching values in the columns that are common to both data-sets.\nIf there is a match then R joins the corresponding rows of data together.\nIf there isn’t a match then it creates NAs where there are missing entries in one row for one data-set which cannot be matched to a row from the joining data-set.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about what we are doing here in chapter: Introduction to linear mixed-effects models and chapter: Introduction to linear mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\n\nIf the pivoting and joining steps have gone according to plan then we should now be looking at a big, long and wide, data-set. But we do not actually require all of the data-set for the analyses we are going to do.\nFor our own convenience, we are going to want to select just the variables we need.\nWe want the variables:\n\nitem_name, subjectID, RT, accuracy\nLg.UK.CDcount, brookesIMG, AoA_Kup_lem\nOrtho_N, regularity, Length, BG_Mean\nVoice,   Nasal,  Fricative,  Liquid_SV\n\nBilabials,   Labiodentals,   Alveolars\nPalatals,    Velars, Glottals, age.months\nTOWREW_skill, TOWRENW_skill, spoonerisms, CART_score\n\n\nPract.Q.5.

What if you wanted to analyze a different set of variables, could you select different variables?\n\n\n\n\nThe data-set includes missing values, designated NA.\n\nHere, every error (coded 0, in accuracy) corresponds to an NA in the RT column.\n\nThe data-set also includes outlier data.\n\nIn this context, \\(RT &lt; 200\\) are probably response errors or equipment failures. We will want to analyse accuracy later, so we shall need to be careful about getting rid of NAs.\n\n\nPract.Q.7. How do we exclude NAs and outliers so that we can do our analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can exclude two sets of observations:\n\nobservations corresponding to correct response reaction times that are too short: \\(RT &lt; 200\\).\nplus observations corresponding to the word false which (because of an Excel formatting problem) dropped item attribute data.\n\nWe can do this using the filter() function, setting conditions on rows, as arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# step 1\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select %&gt;% \n                            filter(item_name != 'FALSE')\n\n# step 2\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select.filter %&gt;%\n                            filter(RT &gt;= 200)\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.8. Can you explain what is going on when you code R to exclude observations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can do the exclusions we need to do using the filter() function, setting conditions on rows, as arguments.\n\n# step 1\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select %&gt;% \n                            filter(item_name != 'FALSE')\n\n# step 2\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select.filter %&gt;%\n                            filter(RT &gt;= 200)\n\nHere, I am using the function filter() to …\n\nCreate a new data-set long.all.select.filter &lt;- ... by\nUsing functions to work on the data named immediately to the right of the assignment arrow: long.all.select\nAn observation is included in the new data-set if it matches the condition specified as an argument in the filter() function call, thus:\n\n\nfilter(item_name !='FALSE') means: include in the new data-set long.all.select.filter all observations from the old data-set long.all.select that are not != (! not = equal to) the value FALSE in the variable item_name,\nthen recreate the long.all.select.filter as a version of itself (with no name change) by including in the new version only those observations where RT was greater than or equal to 200ms using RT &gt;= 200.\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.9. Do you understand what the difference is between = and ==.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to be careful to distinguish these signs.\n\n= assigns a value, so x = 2 means “x equals 2”\n== tests a match so x == 2 means: “is x equal to 2?”\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.10. Can you vary the filter conditions: in different ways?\n\n\nChange the threshold for including RTs from RT &gt;= 200 to something else?\nCan you assess what impact the change has? Note that you can count the number of observations (rows) in a data-set using e.g. length(data.set.name$variable.name)??\n\n\n\n\nThe data-set includes missing values, designated NA. We have not yet dealt with these.\n\nPract.Q.11. How do you remove missing values?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can remove missing values before we go any further, using the na.omit() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlong.all.noNAs &lt;- na.omit(long.all.select.filter)\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.12. Can you explain how the code function works, when we exclude missing NA values?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe na.omit() function is powerful.\nLook at the example code:\n\nlong.all.noNAs &lt;- na.omit(long.all.select.filter)\n\n\nIn using this function, I am asking R to create a new data-set long.all.noNAs from the old data-set long.all.select.filter in a process in which the new data-set will have no rows in which there is a missing value NA in any column.\nYou need to be reasonably sure, when you use this function, where your NAs may be because, otherwise, you may end the process with a new filtered data-set that has many fewer rows in it than you expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have a learnt in following the process of tidying data, step-by-step.\nIf we wanted to, we could complete the process, check that what we have done is correct, and then write the final version of the data-set out to a new .csv using the write_csv() function.\n\nwrite_csv(long.all.noNAs, \"long.all.noNAs.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.13.

Then you will see information about the practical materials you can use to build and practise your skills.\nEvery week, you will learn best if you first watch the lectures then do the practical exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinked resources\n\n\n\nTo help your learning, you can read about the ideas and the practical coding required for analyses in the chapters I wrote for this course.\n\nThe chapter: Introduction to linear mixed-effects models\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lecture materials for this week are presented in three short parts.\nClick on a link and your browser should open a tab showing the Panopto video for the lecture part.\n\nPart 1 (17 minutes) Mixed-effects models: Repeated measures data and the what, when and how of mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\nPart 2 (21 minutes): Working with an example from a study with a repeated measures design, recognizing how people or how stimuli vary, and identifying the motivation for using mixed-effects models, compared to alternative methods.\n\n\n\nPart 3 (15 minutes): What mixed-effects models can do for us, how we can describe the logic, how we code mixed-effects models, what the bits of code do, what the results look like, what the results tell us, and how we should report our models and our findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the lecture slides\n\n\n\nThe slides presented in the videos can be downloaded here:\n\n402-week-18-LME-2.pdf: high resolution .pdf, exactly as delivered [6 MB];\n402-week-18-LME-2_1pp-lo.pdf: lower resolution .pdf, printable version, one-slide-per-page [about 900 KB];\n402-week-18-LME-2_6pp-lo.pdf: lower resolution .pdf, printable version, six-slides-per-page [about 900 KB].\n\nThe high resolution version is the version delivered for the lecture recordings. Because the images are produced to be high resolution, the file size is quite big (6 MB) so, to make the slides easier to download, I produced low resolution versions: 1pp and 6pp. These should be easier to download and print out if that is what you want to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be working with the CP reading study data-set. CP tested 62 children (aged 116-151 months) on reading aloud in English. In the experimental reading task, CP presented 160 words as stimuli. The same 160 words were presented to all children. The words were presented one at a time on a computer screen. Each time a word was shown, each child had to read the word out loud and their response was recorded. Thus, the CP reading study data-set comprised observations about the responses made by 62 children to 160 words.\nYou can read more about these data in the chapter: Introduction to linear mixed-effects models.\nThe critical features of the study are that:\n\nWe have an outcome measure – the reading response – observed multiple times.\n\n\nWe have multiple responses recorded for each participant: they make one response to each stimulus (here, each stimulus word), for the multiple stimuli that they see in the experimental reading task.\nAnd we have multiple responses recorded for each stimulus: one response is made to each stimulus by each participant, for all the participants who completed the task, in a sample of multiple participants.\n\nThe presence of these features is the reason why we need to use mixed-effects models in our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGet the data: get the data file and the .R script you can use to do the exercises that will support your learning.\n\nYou can download the files folder for this chapter by clicking on the link 02-mixed.zip.\n\n\n\nThe practical materials folder includes data files and an .R script:\n\nCP study word naming rt 180211.dat\nCP study word naming acc 180211.dat\nwords.items.5 120714 150916.csv\nall.subjects 110614-050316-290518.csv\nlong.all.noNAs.csv\n402-02-mixed-workbook.R the workbook you will need to do the practical exercises.\n\nThe .dat files are tab delimited files holding behavioural data: the latency or reaction time rt (in milliseconds) and the accuracy acc of response made by each participant to each stimulus.\nThe .csv files are comma separated values files. The words.items file holds information about the 160 stimulus words presented in the experimental reading (word naming) task. The all.subjects file holds information about the 62 participants who volunteered to take part in the experiment.\nIn the following, I will describe a series of steps through which we get the data ready for analysis. However, as we shall see, you can avoid these steps by using the pre-tidied data-set:\n\nlong.all.noNAs.csv\n\nThe data files are collected together through the steps set out in the .R script:\n\n402-02-mixed-workbook.R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou can access the sign-in page for R-Studio Server here\n\n\n\n\nHere, our learning targets are to:\n\nPractice how to tidy experimental data for mixed-effects analysis.\nBegin to develop an understanding of crossed random effects of subjects and stimuli.\nPractice fitting linear mixed-effects models incorporating random effects of subjects and stimuli.\n\nThe aims of the lab session work are to:\n\nGet practice running the code required to tidy and prepare experimental data for analysis.\nExercise skills by varying model code – changing variables, changing options – so that you can see how the code works.\nUse the opportunity to reflect on and evaluate results – so that we can support growth in development of understanding of main ideas.\nOptional – get practice running the code: so that you can reproduce the figures and results from the lecture and in the book chapter.\n\n\n\n\nNow you will progress through a series of tasks, and challenges, to aid your learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWe will work with the data files:\n\nCP study word naming rt 180211.dat\nCP study word naming acc 180211.dat\nwords.items.5 120714 150916.csv\nall.subjects 110614-050316-290518.csv\nlong.all.noNAs.csv\n\n\n\nWe again split the steps into into parts, tasks and questions.\nWe are going to work through the following workflow steps: each step is labelled as a practical part.\n\nSet-up\nLoad the data\nTidy the data\nRead in pre-tidied data\nAnalyze data with lm\nAnalyze data with lmer\nOptional: reproduce the plots in the chapter and slides\n\nIn the following, we will guide you through the tasks and questions step by step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAn answers version of the workbook will be provided after the practical class.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo begin, we set up our environment in R.\n\n\nUse the library() function to make the functions we need available to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere() starts at /Users/robdavies/OneDrive -

Learning to use tidyverse functions will make it easier to cope with this when you do research.\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.2. Can you explain what the read_ functions are doing, or what you are doing with them when you code them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will help your understanding to examine an example. Take a look at what this line of code includes, element by element.\n\nbehaviour.rt &lt;- read_tsv(\"CP study word naming rt 180211.dat\", na = \"-999\")\n\n\nWe write behaviour.rt &lt;- read_tsv(...) to create an object in the R environment, which we call behaviour.rt: the object with this name is the data-set we read into R using read_tsv(...).\nWhen we write the function read_tsv(...) we include two arguments inside it.\nread_tsv(\"CP study word naming rt 180211.dat\", ... first, the name of the file, given in quotes \"\" and then a comma.\nread_tsv(..., na = \"-999\") second, we tell R that there are some missing values na which are coded with the value \"-999\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidying the data involves a number of tasks, some essential and some things we do for our convenience.\n\n\nTo get ready for later analyses, we need to ensure that reaction time (rt) and accuracy (acc) observations are in tidy format.\nWhen we first encounter the data files, the data are untidy because, here, the reaction time (rt) and accuracy (acc) observations are in separate multiple columns. We pivot the data to solve this problem.\n\nYou can read more about what we are doing and why, here, in the chapter: Introduction to linear mixed-effects models.\n\n\nPract.Q.3. How do we do this?\n\n\nYou can try out some solutions, based on what you have done before.\nYou can open the Hint box for a detailed walk-through of the process, and then adapt the hint information.\nAnd you can open the Code box for the example code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use a function you may have seen before: pivot_longer().\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n             pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\nThe name of the function comes from the fact that we are starting with data in wide format e.g. behaviour.rt where we have what should be a single variable of observations (RTs) arranged in a wide series of multiple columns, side-by-side (one column for each participant). But we want to take those wide data and lengthen the data-set, increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.\nLet’s look at this line of code bit by bit.\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n\n\nAt the start, I tell R that I am going to create a new longer data-set (more rows, fewer columns) that I shall call rt.long.\nI will create this longer data-set from &lt;- the original wide data-set behaviour.rt.\nand I will create the new longer data-set by taking the original wide data-set and piping it %&gt;% to the pivot function coded on the next line:\n\n\npivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\n\nOn this next line, I tell R how to do the pivoting by using three arguments.\n\n\npivot_longer(2:62...)\n\n\nFirst, I tell R that I want to re-arrange all the columns that can be found in the data-set from the second column to the sixty-second column.\nIn a spreadsheet, we have a number of columns.\nColumns can be identified by their position in the spreadsheet.\nThe position of a column in a spreadsheet can be identified by number, from the leftmost column (column number 1) to the rightmost column (here, column number 62) in our data-set.\nSo this argument tells R exactly which columns I want to pivot.\n\n\npivot_longer(..., names_to = \"subjectID\", ...)\n\n\nSecond, I tell R that I want it to take the column labels and put them into a new column, called subjectID.\nIn the wide data-set behaviour.rt, each column holds a list of numbers (RTs) but begins with a word in the topmost cell, the name code for a participant, in the column label position.\nWe want to keep the information about which participant produces which response when we pivot the wide data to a longer structure.\nWe do this by asking R to take the column labels (the participant names) and listing them in a new column, called subjectID which now holds the names as participant ID codes.\n\n\npivot_longer(...values_to = \"RT\")\n\n\nThird, we tell R that all the RT values should be put in a single column.\nWe can understand that this new column RT will hold RT observations in a vertical stack, one cell for each response by a person to a word, with rows ordered by subjectID.\n\nThere are 61 columns of data listed by participant though 62 children were tested because we lost one child’s data through an administrative error. As a result, in the wide data sets there are 62 columns, with the first column holding item_name data.\nYou can find more information about pivoting data here\nAnd you can find more information specifically about the pivot_longer() operation here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrt.long &lt;- behaviour.rt %&gt;%\n             pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"RT\")\n\nacc.long &lt;- behaviour.acc %&gt;%\n              pivot_longer(2:62, names_to = \"subjectID\", values_to = \"accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer our research question, we next need to combine the RT with the accuracy data, and then the combined behavioural data with participant information and with stimulus information.\nIn common practice, in psychological research, we have to deal with the fact that information about behavioural responses, and about participant attributes or stimulus word properties, are located in separate files.\nThis is a problem where we need, as here, to analyse outcome behavioural responses using information about participant attributes or stimulus word properties.\n\nPract.Q.4. How do we solve this problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to join the data from the different sources:\n\njoin RT with accuracy then\njoin those response data with data about subject attributes\nthen join those response plus subjects data\nwith item properties data\n\nWe can combine the data-sets, in the way that we need, using the {tidyverse} full_join() function.\n\n\n\nFirst, we join RT and accuracy data together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;% \n          full_join(acc.long)\n\n\n\n\nThen, we join subject and item information to the behavioural data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlong.subjects &lt;- long %&gt;% \n                   full_join(subjects, by = \"subjectID\")\n\nlong.all &lt;- long.subjects %&gt;%\n              full_join(words, by = \"item_name\")\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.4. Can you explain what you are doing, or what the code you use is doing, to solve the problem of putting the separate sets of data together?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, in a series of steps, we take one data-set and join it (merge it) with the second data-set. Let’s look at an example element by element to better understand how this is accomplished.\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;% \n           full_join(acc.long)\n\nThe code work as follows.\n\nlong &lt;- rt.long %&gt;%\n\n\nWe create a new data-set we call long.\nWe do this by taking one original data-set rt.long and %&gt;% piping it to the operation defined in the second step.\n\n\nfull_join(acc.long)\n\n\nIn this second step, we use the function full_join() to add observations from a second original data-set acc.long to those already from rt.long\n\nThe addition of observations from one data-set joining to those from another happens through a matching process.\n\nR looks at the data-sets being merged.\nIt identifies if the two data-sets have columns in common. Here, the data-sets have subjectID and item_name in common).\nR can use these common columns to identify rows of data. Here, each row of data will be identified by both subjectID and item_name i.e. as data about the response made by a participant to a word.\nR will then do a series of identity checks, comparing one data-set with the other and, row by row, looking for matching values in the columns that are common to both data-sets.\nIf there is a match then R joins the corresponding rows of data together.\nIf there isn’t a match then it creates NAs where there are missing entries in one row for one data-set which cannot be matched to a row from the joining data-set.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about what we are doing here in chapter: Introduction to linear mixed-effects models and chapter: Introduction to linear mixed-effects models.\n\n\n\n\nIf the pivoting and joining steps have gone according to plan then we should now be looking at a big, long and wide, data-set. But we do not actually require all of the data-set for the analyses we are going to do.\nFor our own convenience, we are going to want to select just the variables we need.\nWe want the variables:\n\nitem_name, subjectID, RT, accuracy\nLg.UK.CDcount, brookesIMG, AoA_Kup_lem\nOrtho_N, regularity, Length, BG_Mean\nVoice,   Nasal,  Fricative,  Liquid_SV\n\nBilabials,   Labiodentals,   Alveolars\nPalatals,    Velars, Glottals, age.months\nTOWREW_skill, TOWRENW_skill, spoonerisms, CART_score\n\n\nPract.Q.5. How do we get to a data-set with just these variables in it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are going to select just the variables we need using the select() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlong.all.select &lt;- long.all %&gt;% \n                        select(item_name, subjectID, RT, accuracy, \n                               Lg.UK.CDcount, brookesIMG, AoA_Kup_lem, \n                               Ortho_N, regularity, Length, BG_Mean, \n                               Voice,   Nasal,  Fricative,  Liquid_SV,\n                               Bilabials,   Labiodentals,   Alveolars,\n                               Palatals,    Velars, Glottals, \n                               age.months, TOWREW_skill, TOWRENW_skill, \n                               spoonerisms, CART_score)\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.6. What if you wanted to analyze a different set of variables, could you select different variables?\n\n\n\n\nThe data-set includes missing values, designated NA.\n\nHere, every error (coded 0, in accuracy) corresponds to an NA in the RT column.\n\nThe data-set also includes outlier data.\n\nIn this context, \\(RT &lt; 200\\) are probably response errors or equipment failures. We will want to analyse accuracy later, so we shall need to be careful about getting rid of NAs.\n\n\nPract.Q.7. How do we exclude NAs and outliers so that we can do our analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can exclude two sets of observations:\n\nobservations corresponding to correct response reaction times that are too short: \\(RT &lt; 200\\).\nplus observations corresponding to the word false which (because of an Excel formatting problem) dropped item attribute data.\n\nWe can do this using the filter() function, setting conditions on rows, as arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# step 1\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select %&gt;% \n                            filter(item_name != 'FALSE')\n\n# step 2\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select.filter %&gt;%\n                            filter(RT &gt;= 200)\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.8. Can you explain what is going on when you code R to exclude observations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can do the exclusions we need to do using the filter() function, setting conditions on rows, as arguments.\n\n# step 1\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select %&gt;% \n                            filter(item_name != 'FALSE')\n\n# step 2\nlong.all.select.filter &lt;- long.all.select.filter %&gt;%\n                            filter(RT &gt;= 200)\n\nHere, I am using the function filter() to …\n\nCreate a new data-set long.all.select.filter &lt;- ... by\nUsing functions to work on the data named immediately to the right of the assignment arrow: long.all.select\nAn observation is included in the new data-set if it matches the condition specified as an argument in the filter() function call, thus:\n\n\nfilter(item_name !='FALSE') means: include in the new data-set long.all.select.filter all observations from the old data-set long.all.select that are not != (! not = equal to) the value FALSE in the variable item_name,\nthen recreate the long.all.select.filter as a version of itself (with no name change) by including in the new version only those observations where RT was greater than or equal to 200ms using RT &gt;= 200.\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.9. Do you understand what the difference is between = and ==.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to be careful to distinguish these signs.\n\n= assigns a value, so x = 2 means “x equals 2”\n== tests a match so x == 2 means: “is x equal to 2?”\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.10. Can you vary the filter conditions: in different ways?\n\n\nChange the threshold for including RTs from RT &gt;= 200 to something else?\nCan you assess what impact the change has? Note that you can count the number of observations (rows) in a data-set using e.g. length(data.set.name$variable.name)??\n\n\n\n\nThe data-set includes missing values, designated NA. We have not yet dealt with these.\n\nPract.Q.11. How do you remove missing values?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can remove missing values before we go any further, using the na.omit() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlong.all.noNAs &lt;- na.omit(long.all.select.filter)\n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.12. Can you explain how the code function works, when we exclude missing NA values?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe na.omit() function is powerful.\nLook at the example code:\n\nlong.all.noNAs &lt;- na.omit(long.all.select.filter)\n\n\nIn using this function, I am asking R to create a new data-set long.all.noNAs from the old data-set long.all.select.filter in a process in which the new data-set will have no rows in which there is a missing value NA in any column.\nYou need to be reasonably sure, when you use this function, where your NAs may be because, otherwise, you may end the process with a new filtered data-set that has many fewer rows in it than you expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have a learnt in following the process of tidying data, step-by-step.\nIf we wanted to, we could complete the process, check that what we have done is correct, and then write the final version of the data-set out to a new .csv using the write_csv() function.\n\nwrite_csv(long.all.noNAs, \"long.all.noNAs.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.13. If you want to skip the tidying process steps, assuming you have written the tidied data-set out to a new .csv file, what would you do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlong.all.noNAs &lt;- read_csv(\"long.all.noNAs.csv\", \n                           col_types = cols(\n                             subjectID = col_factor(),\n                             item_name = col_factor()\n                           )\n                          ) \n\n\n\n\n\nPract.Q.14.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I am sharing materials here to support the development of skills in producing reproducible reports using Quarto.\nThese materials should provide a quick entry to the what, why and how.\nYou can write in Quarto, in R-Studio (or any code editor), to produce:\n\nreports or manuscripts;\npresentations;\nbooks;\nwebpages.\n\nHere, we are going to focus on reports that will be output as .docx.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhat we are engaged in, here, is writing a combination of text and (here, R) code to generate a document.\nThis idea is old — see: e.g., Donald Knuth (who developed LaTex): https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html\nBut Quarto is a modern, efficient, way to do a powerful thing easily and efficiently.\n\n\n\n\nQuarto was developed by Posit (formerly: R-Studio).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can find the Posit guide to Quarto here:\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you get started, you will need a local installation of R and R-Studio.\n\n\nInstall R first, following the instructions here:\n\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/\n\nThen install R, see:\n\nhttps://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nYou need to do the installation in that order because R-Studio is the interface (an Interactive Development Editor (IDE)) but R does the work.\n\nIt is probably worth your time having a skim of the “hello world” quick start guide:\n\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least the following justifications for investing time in this (in no particular order):\n\nReproducible manuscripts: create documents that incorporate text, computation or plotting code, and bibliographic information in one place so that you can avoid the risks of the standard workflow:\n\n\nRisks: lose track of what data underlie which calculations or plots or table summaries.\n\n\nAutomate the boring stuff: figure, table or section cross-referencing; producing documents in different formats; generating bibliographies.\nMake manuscripts or presentations or notes share-able: Quarto is free so removes barrier to entry presented by licensed software like MS Word.\nMake nice things: plots and tables will look better.\n\n\n\n\nOpen R-Studio.\nClick on the menu buttons:\n\nFile \\(\\rightarrow\\) New File \\(\\rightarrow\\) Quarto Document...\nA menu box will open: click on the Word radio button, and the Create button.\n\n\n\n\nNew Create Document menu box\n\n\nIf you do that, you will see this file open:\n\n\n\nA new .qmd file\n\n\n\nSee that Render button at the top of the window? Click on it.\n\n\nYou will be asked to give the file a name. Name it.\n\nThis action will create a Quarto script file, a .qmd and will generate a Word .docx.\nThe whole script looks like this:\n\n\n\nA new .qmd file: dummy file\n\n\nAnd the .docx looks like this:\n\n\n\nA new .qmd file: dummy file output\n\n\n\n\nThis example shows you the main parts of a Quarto file. Let’s identify these parts before we move on:\n\nThe yaml at the top is where you set document options:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Untitled\"\nformat: docx\neditor: visual\n---\nUsually, this will be where you specify what output formats you want, whether you want a ToC, and (for APA 7 documents) it will be where you add author, title and abstract information, see more information here:\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html\n\nYou have section titles:\n\n## Quarto\nNotice the ## – the more hash signs you add, the lower the section title in the section hierarchy.\n\nYou have plain text:\n\nQuarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see &lt;https://quarto.org&gt;.\n\nAnd you have computing code — chunks:\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: example\n1 + 1\n```\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nThe tick marks are at the top and bottom of the chunks tell R to read the code and work with it.\nNotice that you can specify the identity (for cross-referencing) and the behaviour or appearance of the code at the top of the chunk.\n\n\n\n\nIn writing reports, we are often going to want to do tasks like:\n\nGet sample data and show:\n\n\nDistributions or other preliminary information to characterize samples.\n\n\nFit a model.\n\n\nPresent a table summary of the model estimates.\nPresent a plot showing model predictions.\n\n\nCross-reference figures, tables and sections.\n\nWe look at how to do these things next.\n\n\nWe will be working with an example data-set: click on the link to download the example data file.\n\nstudy-one-general-participants.csv\n\nThe file has the structure you can see in the extract below.\n\n\n\n\n\nparticipant_ID\nmean.acc\nmean.self\nstudy\nAGE\nSHIPLEY\nHLVA\nFACTOR3\nQRITOTAL\nGENDER\nEDUCATION\nETHNICITY\n\n\n\n\nstudytwo.1\n0.4107143\n6.071429\nstudytwo\n26\n27\n6\n50\n9\nFemale\nHigher\nAsian\n\n\nstudytwo.10\n0.6071429\n8.500000\nstudytwo\n38\n24\n9\n58\n15\nFemale\nSecondary\nWhite\n\n\nstudytwo.100\n0.8750000\n8.928571\nstudytwo\n66\n40\n13\n60\n20\nFemale\nHigher\nWhite\n\n\nstudytwo.101\n0.9642857\n8.500000\nstudytwo\n21\n31\n11\n59\n14\nFemale\nHigher\nWhite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the scroll bar at the bottom of the data window to view different columns.\nYou can see the columns:\n\nparticipant_ID participant code;\nmean.acc average accuracy of response to questions testing understanding of health guidance (varies between 0-1);\nmean.self average self-rated accuracy of understanding of health guidance (varies between 1-9);\nstudy variable coding for what study the data were collected in\nAGE age in years;\nHLVA health literacy test score (varies between 1-16);\nSHIPLEY vocabulary knowledge test score (varies between 0-40);\nFACTOR3 reading strategy survey score (varies between 0-80);\nGENDER gender code;\nEDUCATION education level code;\nETHNICITY ethnicity (Office National Statistics categories) code.\n\n\n\nDownload and read the data into the R environment.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: data-read-in\nstudy.two.gen &lt;- read_csv(\"study-one-general-participants.csv\")\n```\n\nRows: 169 Columns: 12\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (5): participant_ID, study, GENDER, EDUCATION, ETHNICITY\ndbl (7): mean.acc, mean.self, AGE, SHIPLEY, HLVA, FACTOR3, QRITOTAL\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the distribution of ages in this sample.\nYou can do that by examining a histogram, see Figure 1.\nYou can embed the code that does that work, together with your text, in a chunk like this:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-example-histogram\nstudy.two.gen %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = AGE)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  labs(title = \"Sample characteristics\", x = \"Age (years\") +\n  theme_bw() \n```\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, unless you are teaching, or sharing your workings as part of your documentation, you are going to want to embed a chunk of code to produce a plot so that the plot is presented in your output document while the code chunk that does the work is invisible (at output).\nYou may also want to add a figure caption and alt-text, and you will want to manipulate figure dimensions.\nWe can learn how to do that stuff while producing a scatterplot, next.\nLet’s do something a little fancy, see ?@fig-ggextra-demo-non-eval.\nTo produce the plot, you will need to have installed the {ggExtra} library.\nLet’s go through the control elements first.\nTake a look at the chunk of code:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-ggextra-demo-non-eval\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the potential association between accuracy of comprehension and health literacy\"\n#| fig-alt: \"The figure presents a grid of scatterplots indicating the association between variables mean accuracy (on y-axis) and health literacy (x-axis) scores. The points are shown in black, and clustered such that higher health literacy scores tend to be associated with higher accuracy scores. The trend is indicated by a thick red line. Marginal histograms indicates the distributio of data on each variable.\"\n#| warning: false\n#| eval: false\n#| fig-width: 4.5\n#| fig-height: 4.5\n# -- note that can use gridExtra\n# -- to show marginal distributions in scatterplots\n# https://github.com/daattali/ggExtra\nplot &lt;- study.two.gen %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = HLVA, y = mean.acc)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1.75, alpha = .5) +\n  geom_smooth(size = 1.5, colour = \"red\", method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  xlim(0, 15) +\n  ylim(0, 1.1)+\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.15)),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5))\n  ) +\n  labs(x = 'Health literacy (HLVA)', y = 'Mean accuracy')\nggExtra::ggMarginal(plot, type = \"histogram\", colour = \"lightgrey\", fill = \"lightgrey\")\n```\n\nNotice the bits of text at the top of the chunk:\n\n#| label: fig-ggextra-demo-non-eval labels the chunk. You need this for figure referencing.\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing ...\" adds the caption that will be shown next to the plot.\n#| fig-alt: \"The figure presents ...\" adds alt-text describing the plot for people who use screen readers.\n#| warning: false stops R from producing the plot with warnings.\n#| echo: false stops R from showing both the code and the plot.\n#| eval: false here stops R from actually running the code.\n#| fig-width: 4.5 adjusts figure width.\n#| fig-height: 4.5 adjusts figure height.\n\nYou can see that I have added comments: # -- note that can use gridExtra to make the chunk self-documenting.\nNow show the plot: Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Scatterplot showing the potential association between accuracy of comprehension and health literacy\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about chunk options here:\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html#chunk-options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that the figure reference is computed by Quarto:\n\nIf the code chunk has a label like #| label: fig-ggextra-demo-eval (notice the grammar fig-...)\nand the text outside the chunk has the reference code @fig-ggextra-demo-eval then R will link the two objects, and write the reference in the rendered document.\nFigure reference numbers will be automated tallied by R.\n\n\n\nRead more about alt-text here:\nhttps://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/posts/28-fig-alt/\n\n\n\nNow let’s fit a model and get some results.\nLet’s assume we want to model the effect of health literacy on mean accuracy of understanding of health information.\nLet’s say that our model assumes:\n\\[\ny_i \\sim \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nwhere:\n\nOutcome mean accuracy of response \\(y_i\\) is expected to vary, on average\nIn relation to \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1\\)\n\nwhere:\n\\(\\beta_1X_1\\) the coefficient of the effect of variation in health literacy.\nThis is how you write math in Quarto (notice the dollar signs):\n\n$y_i \\sim \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\epsilon_i$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI’m not writing the math because this is a serious model but to show off the equation writing capacities of Quarto.\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html\nIt is much, much user friendly, and accurate, than MS Word equation builders.\nYou can read more about writing equations in:\nhttps://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics#Operators\n\n\nSo fit the model and get a summary:\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mean.acc ~ HLVA, data = study.two.gen)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mean.acc ~ HLVA, data = study.two.gen)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.40848 -0.05304  0.01880  0.07608  0.19968 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, unless you are teaching, or sharing your workings as part of your documentation, you are going to want to embed a chunk of code to produce a plot so that the plot is presented in your output document while the code chunk that does the work is invisible (at output).\nYou may also want to add a figure caption and alt-text, and you will want to manipulate figure dimensions.\nWe can learn how to do that stuff while producing a scatterplot, next.\nLet’s do something a little fancy, see ?@fig-ggextra-demo-non-eval.\nTo produce the plot, you will need to have installed the {ggExtra} library.\nLet’s go through the control elements first.\nTake a look at the chunk of code:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-ggextra-demo-non-eval\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing the potential association between accuracy of comprehension and health literacy\"\n#| fig-alt: \"The figure presents a grid of scatterplots indicating the association between variables mean accuracy (on y-axis) and health literacy (x-axis) scores. The points are shown in black, and clustered such that higher health literacy scores tend to be associated with higher accuracy scores. The trend is indicated by a thick red line. Marginal histograms indicates the distributio of data on each variable.\"\n#| warning: false\n#| eval: false\n#| fig-width: 4.5\n#| fig-height: 4.5\n# -- note that can use gridExtra\n# -- to show marginal distributions in scatterplots\n# https://github.com/daattali/ggExtra\nplot &lt;- study.two.gen %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = HLVA, y = mean.acc)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1.75, alpha = .5) +\n  geom_smooth(size = 1.5, colour = \"red\", method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  xlim(0, 15) +\n  ylim(0, 1.1)+\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(size = rel(1.15)),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5))\n  ) +\n  labs(x = 'Health literacy (HLVA)', y = 'Mean accuracy')\nggExtra::ggMarginal(plot, type = \"histogram\", colour = \"lightgrey\", fill = \"lightgrey\")\n```\n\nNotice the bits of text at the top of the chunk:\n\n#| label: fig-ggextra-demo-non-eval labels the chunk. You need this for figure referencing.\n#| fig-cap: \"Scatterplot showing ...\" adds the caption that will be shown next to the plot.\n#| fig-alt: \"The figure presents ...\" adds alt-text describing the plot for people who use screen readers.\n#| warning: false stops R from producing the plot with warnings.\n#| echo: false stops R from showing both the code and the plot.\n#| eval: false here stops R from actually running the code.\n#| fig-width: 4.5 adjusts figure width.\n#| fig-height: 4.5 adjusts figure height.\n\nYou can see that I have added comments: # -- note that can use gridExtra to make the chunk self-documenting.\nNow show the plot: Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Scatterplot showing the potential association between accuracy of comprehension and health literacy\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about chunk options here:\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html#chunk-options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that the figure reference is computed by Quarto:\n\nIf the code chunk has a label like #| label: fig-ggextra-demo-eval (notice the grammar fig-...)\nand the text outside the chunk has the reference code @fig-ggextra-demo-eval then R will link the two objects, and write the reference in the rendered document.\nFigure reference numbers will be automated tallied by R.\n\n\n\nRead more about alt-text here:\nhttps://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/posts/28-fig-alt/\n\n\n\nNow let’s fit a model and get some results.\nLet’s assume we want to model the effect of health literacy on mean accuracy of understanding of health information.\nLet’s say that our model assumes:\n\\[\ny_i \\sim \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nwhere:\n\nOutcome mean accuracy of response \\(y_i\\) is expected to vary, on average\nIn relation to \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1\\)\n\nwhere:\n\\(\\beta_1X_1\\) the coefficient of the effect of variation in health literacy.\nThis is how you write math in Quarto (notice the dollar signs):\n\n$y_i \\sim \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\epsilon_i$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI’m not writing the math because this is a serious model but to show off the equation writing capacities of Quarto.\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html\nIt is much, much user friendly, and accurate, than MS Word equation builders.\nYou can read more about writing equations in:\nhttps://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics#Operators\n\n\nSo fit the model and get a summary:\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mean.acc ~ HLVA, data = study.two.gen)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mean.acc ~ HLVA, data = study.two.gen)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.40848 -0.05304  0.01880  0.07608  0.19968 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.
