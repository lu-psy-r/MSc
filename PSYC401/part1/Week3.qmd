# Part 1: Revision from last week

## Task 1: Describe and load the data set you found for your take-home task

1.  Your take-home task was to download a data set that accompanied a
    paper published in Psychological Science. Describe this data set to
    the rest of your group.

2.  Load your data set into Rstudio.

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" collapse="true"}
## Hint

use read_csv(), or one of the other read functions from the last part of
the Practical week2 workbook. You may need to load `library(tidyverse)`.
:::

3.  View the data set, and then make a new data set from this data set,
    by selecting just two variables.

4.  Is it appropriate to draw a histogram or a scatter plot of the two
    variables? If so, draw it. If not, why not?

5.  Make sure these commands are in the source window, save them as a
    new R file, e.g., "mypsychscidata.r"

Part 2: Reproduce the Lecture week3 part3 analyses

## Task 2: Load in the data, draw a histogram, find means and standard deviations

6.  Create a new r script, called psyc401_week3.r, and clear out R studio ready for a new script using `rm(list=ls())`.

7.  Download the data files on the vocabulary tests here: [PSYC401-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.zip](data/PSYC401-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.zip). You should then upload the entire zip folder to the R server.

8.  Load the data into an object called "dat" using `read_csv()`, what command line do you use? (remember to set the working directory)

9.  View the data. What command do you use?

10. We can make a histogram of the first time people took the Gent
    vocabulary test:

```{r eval=FALSE}

hist(dat$Gent_1_score)

```

11. And a histogram of the second time people took the Gent test, what
    command line do you use?

12. We can find out means and standard deviations. We will use the
    `mean()` and the `sd()` functions. However, we need to tell R studio
    what to do with the missing values (called NA in the View), to do
    that we have to add an extra bit to the command:

```{r eval=FALSE}

mean(dat$Gent_1_score, na.rm=TRUE)

```

This tells R studio to remove the NA values before computing the mean.
What happens if you don't add `na.rm=TRUE`?

What is the mean and standard deviation of Gent_1\_score and
Gent_2\_score?

## Task 3: Use ggplot to draw some histograms:

13. Now we are going to use another way of making graphs. This is more
    flexible than the `hist` function. Here is how to make a histogram
    of the Gent vocabulary scores:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(dat, aes(x = Gent_1_score) ) + geom_histogram(fill="blue") + labs(title="Gent Vocabulary Test 1", x = "Vocabulary Score", y = "Frequency")

```

14. And for the second Gent test:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(dat, aes(x = Gent_2_score) ) + geom_histogram(fill="red") + labs(title="Gent Vocabulary Test 2", x = "Vocabulary Score", y = "Frequency")

```

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
Breaking it down: `ggplot(dat, aes(x = Gent_1_score))`: this calls the
plotting function ggplot we specify the data set we will use, `dat` and
we set the data for the plot, in this case we say that the x value (so
that's what will be along the x-axis in the graph) is the Gent_1\_score.
We put this inside `aes()`, which stands for "aesthetic".
`+ geom_histogram(fill="blue")`: this adds a graph of type histogram and
colours it blue
`+ labs(title="Gent Vocabulary Test", x = "Vocabulary Score", y = "Frequency")`:
this adds labels to the graph: title, the x-axis label and the y-axis
label.
:::

# Part 3: Practise manipulating data

## Task 4: Practise manipulating data

15. Let's keep only some of the variables from the dataset dat - let's
    remove Gender_code, and Dyslexia_diagnosis. Keep the other variables
    using `select()` and load this into summarydata

```{r eval=FALSE}

summarydata <- select(.data = dat, subject_ID, Age, english_status, Gender, Shipley_Voc_Score, Gent_1_score, Gent_2_score, academic_year)

```

16. Next we will have a bit more of a wander around the data to get a
    feel for it. We will first use the function `arrange()`, which
    changes the order of observations (rows):

```{r eval=FALSE}

arrange(.data = summarydata, Shipley_Voc_Score)

```

What is the lowest score of a participant on the Shipley Vocabulary
questionnaire? (You may like to make a new object, which is the result
of the `arrange` function, then look at it in View).

17. If you want to order from highest to lowest, you have to use the
    `desc()` function:

```{r eval=FALSE}

arrange(.data = summarydata, desc(Shipley_Voc_Score))

```

What is the highest value on the Shipley Vocabulary Test? How many
participants have this highest score?

18. Next we will use the `filter()` function. This includes or excludes
    certain observations (rows). Let's just include the participants
    with English as a first language and put this into a new object,
    called summarydata_enl. What are the mean and SD values of the
    Shipley Vocabulary test for the native speakers?

```{r eval=FALSE}

summarydata_enl <- filter(.data = summarydata, english_status == 'native')

```

19. Make another variable with the z-scores of the Shipley Vocabulary
    test (see week 1 workbook). What are the maximum and minimum
    z-scores?

20. Remember to save your script file.

# Part 4: Graphing data

## Task 5: graphing data using histograms

21. Previously we used plot to draw a scatter plot, and hist to draw a
    histogram. Now, we're going to use ggplot which can draw all kinds
    of graphs, with a great deal more flexibility. We are going to
    represent the data to reflect the following relations:

-   English status and gender
-   Age and vocabulary score
-   Gender and vocabulary score
-   Academic year and vocabulary score
-   Academic year and age
-   English status and vocabulary score
-   English status and age

But first, let's repeat reproducing the histogram from the overhead
slides to look at the distribution of variables:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Gent_1_score)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="blue") + 
  labs(title="Gent Vocabulary Test 1", x = "Vocabulary Score", y = "Frequency")
```

22. Now draw a histogram with Shipley_Voc_Score as the variable and
    colour it orange. Remember to change the title to something
    appropriate.

## Task 6: graphing data using bar graphs

23. Next let's look at English status and gender. What types of variable
    are these? Nominal? Ordinal? Interval/ratio?

24. We will draw a bar graph of the counts. We use `geom_bar()` for
    this:

-   First try this:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Gender)) + 
  geom_bar()

```

-   This just draws counts of Gender
-   Now let's draw Gender and English Status together:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = Gender, fill = english_status)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

```

Note 1: We use position dodge so that it puts the bars next to each
other (what happens if you leave out `position = dodge`?)

Note 2: We use `fill = english_status` so that it fills the different
bars with different colours according to different english statuses.

What is the general pattern of counts? Are there proportional
differences by English status according to gender?

## Task 7: graphing data using scatterplot

25. Next we'll look at Age and Shipley Vocabulary Score. What types of
    data are these?

26. We will draw a point plot of these values:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Age, y = Shipley_Voc_Score)) + geom_point()

```

We can add
`+ labs(title = "Age by Shipley Vocabulary Score", x = "Age", y = "Shipley Vocabulary Score")`
to tidy up presentation a bit.

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Age, y = Shipley_Voc_Score)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Age by Shipley Vocabulary Score", x = "Age", y = "Shipley Vocabulary Score")

```

-   What is the relation between age and Shipley Vocabulary score?

## Task 8: Draw and interpret a box plot

27. Next on the list of relations to check is gender and vocabulary
    score. Let's look at Gent_1\_score against Gender. What type of
    variables are these?

28. We will draw a box plot (you could draw a bar graph, but box plots
    tend to be preferred for these combinations of variables - use a bar
    graph for counts):

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Gender, y = Gent_1_score)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 

```

-   Again we can tidy this up by adding labels:

```{r eval=FALSE}

ggplot(summarydata, aes(x= Gender, y = Gent_1_score)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "Vocabulary Score by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Gent Vocabulary Score Test 1")

```

29. Interpreting box plots: The horizontal line indicates the median.
    The box indicates where 50% of the data lie. The lines indicate an
    estimate of the range of the data (minimum and maximum values). The
    dots indicate outliers. A large box indicates larger standard
    deviation. If the boxes don't overlap much then this indicates there
    may be a difference between the groups.

-   Are there differences in Vocabulary according to gender?

30. Now for the other relations:

-   Academic year and vocabulary score
-   Academic year and age
-   English status and vocabulary score
-   English status and age

At the moment, R is interpreting Academic year as a number. We need to
turn it into a nominal variable (called a "factor" in R studio):

```{r eval=FALSE}

summarydata$academic_year <- as.factor(summarydata$academic_year)

```

Draw a graph for each of these relations.

31. Save your R script.

# Part 5: More practise manipulating data

32. For finding minimum and maximum values, we have used the `arrange()`
    function. However, if you were designing R, what would you call the
    function that could just print the minimum values for you. See if
    your intuitions are right (if you have them), and/or search (on the
    internet) for the R function that finds the minimum or maximum
    values. What is the R command for finding the minimum and maximum
    values of the Shipley Vocabulary scores?

33. An important part of using R-studio is that people share their code,
    their tutorials, and help one another out in troubleshooting.
    Searching for commands and how to use them on search engines is
    absolutely fine, and supplementing your learning with others'
    tutorials is also what the community does.

Glasgow University psychology department has made some of their course
materials available and so for more practise in using the different data
manipulation functions, you could have a look at
https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-conv/data-wrangling-1.html Ignore the
part about making a new R markdown document, use instead an R script.
Just go straight to clear out the environment rm(list=ls()) then load
the libraries tidyverse() and babynames() where the babynames() library
contains the database on babies' names that you can explore in the
example. And then begin at Section "4.4: Activity 2: Look at the data".

# Part 6: Take home exercise

For the data that you downloaded from the Psychological Science paper
for your take home exercise last week, construct some graphs to show
relations between variables.

::: callout-note
Use `geom_bar()` for bar graphs of counts Use `geom_box()` for box plots
showing means Use `geom_point()` to show relations between two or more
variables Use `geom_histogram()` to show distributions of one or more
variables
